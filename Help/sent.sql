Investigative reporter Karina Danes (Minnie Driver) arrives from Los Angeles to pursue the story and angers both the local police and the factory owners who employee the undocumented aliens with her pointed questions and relentless quest for the truth.<br /><br />Her story goes nationwide when a young girl named Mariela (Ana Claudia Talancon) survives a vicious attack and walks out of the desert crediting the Blessed Virgin for her rescue. Her story is further enhanced when the \"Wounds of Christ\" (stigmata) appear in her palms. She also claims to have received a message of hope for the Virgin Mary and soon a fanatical movement forms around her to fight against the evil that holds such a stranglehold on the area.<br /><br />Critique: Possessing a lifelong fascination with such esoteric matters as Catholic mysticism, miracles and the mysterious appearance of the stigmata, I was immediately attracted to the \'05 DVD release `Virgin of Juarez\'. The film offers a rather unique storyline blending current socio-political concerns, the constant flow of Mexican migrant workers back and forth across the U.S./Mexican border and the traditional Catholic beliefs of the Hispanic population. I must say I was quite surprised by the unexpected route taken by the plot and the means and methods by which the heavenly message unfolds.<br /><br />`Virgin of Juarez\' is not a film that you would care to watch over and over again, but it was interesting enough to merit at least one viewing. Minnie Driver delivers a solid performance and Ana Claudia Talancon is perfect as the fragile and innocent visionary Mariela. Also starring Esai Morales and Angus Macfadyen (Braveheart).'),(2,1,'B003AI2VGA','Blue Jasmine','Worthwhile and Important Story Hampered by Poor Script and Production','THE VIRGIN OF JUAREZ is based on true events surrounding the crime problems of Juarez, Mexico reflected in the gringo exploitation of businesses in neighboring El Paso, Texas.  The story contains many important facts that desperately need to be brought into the light, but the impact of the film falters because of the choices made by the writer and director.<br /><br />Karina Danes (Minnie Driver) is a journalist for a Los Angeles newspaper who has flown to Juarez to investigate the multiple (in the hundreds) killings of young women. The targets for these murders seem to be young women working in the US sponsored sweatshops in Juarez who are picked up at night after work, raped, beaten and killed.  Danes is convinced the Juarez police force is doing nothing and takes on the mission of exposing the tragedies, in part due to her own past issues of being too idle with similar crimes in the US.  She meets Father Herrera (Esai Morales) and a community activist Patrick (Angus MacFadyen) and together they probe the police files and follow the most recent murder, discovering along the way a survivor named Mariela (Ana Claudia Talanc&oacute;n), a frightened young girl whose memory of her rape and beating is erased by her apparent vision of the Virgin Mary.  A father of one of the victims, Isidro (Jorge Cervera, Jr.) nurtures Mariela and helps her to escape the hospital, placing her in a \'church\' where she becomes a \'saint\' to the people of Juarez who long for the crimes to end.  Mariela appears to the public with the stigmata of bleeding hands and offers hope to the victims\' families.  Danes works hard to discover evidence that will expose the perpetrators, taking a sheet of photos of \'most wanted men\' from the police office of Detective Lauro (Jacob Vargas), and works with the police and Father Herrera to resolve the tragic chain of events that continue in Juarez. Fearing for Mariela\'s life, they transport her to Los Angeles where mysterious events end the story.<br /><br />The squeaky, mawkish script was written by Michael Fallon and directed by Kevin James Dobson.  Had their vision been more directed toward defining the line between realism and fanaticism, the story would possibly have been better related.  There are some good performances by Driver, Talanc&oacute;n, Morales, and Vargas but the minor roles vary in quality.  Reporting atrocities such as the one this film addresses is a valid and valuable contribution of contemporary cinema.  It is sad when script and the production dull the impact.  Grady Harp, June 07'),(5,2,'B003AI2VGA','Blue Jasmine','This movie needed to be made.','The scenes in this film can be very disquieting due to their graphic re-enactment of real events, but this story needs to be told. I will say the violence was injected into the movie with as much taste as manageable when dealing with rape scenes, etc. Inspired by true events, women are being murdered in Juarez after they leave the factory where they work. A fearful community is suddenly given some hope when one of the young victims not only lives, but experiences \'stigmata\' after seeing the Virgin Mary.  I was shocked to learn that murders in Juarez are still happening and many are unsolved. I believe this director brought a very important story to the surface. Though it\'s never pleasant to think about young women being murdered, this movie depicts a harsh reality of the high cost of exploited-cheap labor.<br /><br />Chrissy K. McVay - Author'),(6,2,'B003AI2VGA','Blue Jasmine','distantly based on a real tragedy','THE VIRGIN OF JUAREZ (2006)<br />directed by Kevin James Dobson<br />approx. 1 hour 25 minutes<br /><br />The town of Juarez, Chihuahua in Mexico is just across the border from El Paso, Texas.  It is home to several factories owned by American companies who employ Mexicans at very low wages.  Since the early 1990s, Juarez has also been the murder site of hundreds of women.  There is a lot of debate as to whether the deaths are the work of a drug gang or a serial killer.  It has also been suggested that due to the local police department\'s failure to solve the crimes, new rapists and thugs have moved to the area knowing that they will never be caught.  The situation is an overwhelming tragedy and this movie uses the story as a backdrop.<br /><br />We start off seeing how unsafe women feel as they walk and work in Juarez.  Then we meet the hard-headed American journalist played by Minnie Driver.  She aggressively questions the local police and befriends a Catholic priest.  Within the first twenty minutes or so, we see the terrifying reality of the situation in Juarez.<br /><br />At this point, the story jumps from something that might have happened to something that is only found in this movie.  A woman named Mariela survives an brutal attack but is in critical condition in a small hospital.  While the priest is speaking to her, she lets out a howl... and her hands begin bleeding*.  This \"stigmata\" is meant to show that she has been blessed by the Virgin Mary.  Our reporter protagonist clashes with various authorities on what should be done.  Meanwhile Mariela goes underground and attracts a devoted following, eventually landing her own radio show (!) and living under the protection of gang members, whom she refers to as \"modern warriors\".  The only thing missing is \"Jes&uacute;s Malverde\".<br /><br />Now I understand that we don\'t know everything about the Juarez murders and that a screenwriter has to \"fill in the blanks\" when crafting an exciting dramatization.  However if you are going to deviate so far from the true story, then don\'t preface your movie as being \"based on the ongoing unsolved murders in Cuidad Juarez\".  There is plenty of interesting and legitimate information in the REAL stories of Juarez and there is no need to fabricate.  This movie may \"raise the issue\" of the Juarez women, but it isn\'t really about them at all!<br /><br />If you are interested in learning more about the killings in Juarez, there are a few documentaries.  A recent one from Las Perlas Del Mar Films is simply titled \'JUAREZ\' and is a good introduction.  Zulma Aguiar\'s \'JUAREZ MOTHERS FIGHT FEMICIDE\' (focuses on the families) is also easy to find.  There is another one which I haven\'t seen titled \'BORDER ECHOES\'.<br /><br />*- note to Hollywood:<br />the nails that crucified Jesus were through his wrists, not his palms!'),(7,2,'B003AI2VGA','Blue Jasmine','What\'s going on down in Juarez and shining a light on it','Informationally, this SHOWTIME original is essential viewing for enlightening audiences on the dangerous plight of women migrant workers from Los Angeles who are routinely and mysteriously murdered on the border between Juarez, Mexico and El Paso, Texas.Since 1993, hundreds of woman have turned up dead and mutilated and no one seems to either care or have an answer. The fear and death continue.<br /><br />Director Kevin Dobson has brought us Michael Fallon\'s screenplay THE VIRGIN OF JUAREZ to the screen as a fanciful/possible solution to what may be happening down in Juarez.Though this is but a film, the information about the unsolved murders and the religious fanaticism in the area is crucial.<br /><br />Suggested companion film would be AGNES OF GOD.'),(8,2,'B003AI2VGA','Blue Jasmine','Pretty pointless fictionalization','The murders in Juarez are real.

Mexican women are semi-pagan, pious fools.

This latest dvd &quot;Rock, Rhythm And &quot;Doo Wop&quot;, is a total delight to ones ears.  Keep in mind all these vintage artists recorded in an era, when vocal talent was essential, to get a recording contract?  They did not have modern day computerized overdub technology, which enables many modern day artist\'s with limited ability to survive?  This dvd reads like a who\'s who of early rock.  The architect of rock, Little Richard starts off this concert with a stomping version of &quot;Keep-A Rockin&quot;, and the line-up that follows, keeps this concert at a premium level of performances.  You get to see and hear Lou Christie, Little Anthony and the Imperials, Jerry Butler, Lloyd Price, Joey Dee and the Starliters, Frankie Valli, Fred Paris and the Satins and the Countours, just to name a few.  However, nothing prepared me for the performance of Jay Black and the Americans?  After singing &quot;This Magic Moment&quot;, Jay gave a performance, that could make anybody from the babyboomer era feel young again.  As he prepared to sing &quot;Cara Mia&quot;, he joked that he first recorded the song at age 25, and must now at age 62, hit those same notes?  Hit those notes he did!  Using that opera trained voice, he delivered a powerful performance that had the entire audience on it\'s feet, showering him with a well deserved standing ovation.  If you are a fan of the old-time vocal and rock sound of the 50\'s and 60\'s, this is an absolute must have dvd.  I highly recommend this to everyone, who enjoys those golden oldies.'),(11,3,'B00006HAXW','Blue Ruin','A  MUST-HAVE  video if you grew up in the 50\'s or 60\'s','I recvd this video (DVD version) as a Christmas gift.  I put it on about 11 pm just to see what it was like, and finally got dragged to bed about 4:30 in the morning.  It\'s the best \"Oldies\" video I\'ve ever seen.  It was recorded LAST YEAR by the original singers - now mostly in their 60\'s, and they\'re still great - Jay and the Americans, Lou Christie, The Five Satins, Little Richard, Kathy Young, Little Anthony, The Fleetwoods, Jerry Butler, Lloyd Price, Frankie Valli and about 10 other acts.  These guys sing for sheer pride and the love of singing, and it all shows.  It\'s a concert for PBS patrons filmed in Pittsburgh, PA, and distributed around the country to donors.  They mention that this was the third concert, and I want ALL of them.  Although the Amazon notes say this is a black and white video it is actually in color and very well produced.  The producer in fact is just a kid -only about 30 years old - but treats all of these acts with the greatest of respect, and truly celebrates their works. The DVD also has about an hour of excellent interviews.'),(12,3,'B00006HAXW','Blue Ruin','If You Like DooWop You Gotta Have This DVD','Wow! When I saw this show on PBS--that was it, I had to have this!  What great tunes!  And seeing these groups--terrific! I couldn\'t find a list of songs, so here\'s some of them: Keep-a-Knockin--Little Richard; Sea Cruise--Frankie Ford; A Thousand Stars--Kathi Young (still cute!) and the Innocents; Silhouettes by the Rays; Do You Love Me--The Contours; Have You Heard--The Duprees; over 40 songs in all, including Little Anthony, The Five Satins, Lloyd Price, The Skyliners, The Fleetwoods, Jay &amp; the Americans (This Magic Moment, Cara Mia and Come a Little Bit Closer!); Lou Christie; plus Franki Valli and Jerry Butler as hosts. Plus interviews with Kathi Young, Lou Christie and the producer TJ Lubinski (thanks TJ!)'),(13,3,'B00006HAXW','Blue Ruin','I expected more.','I have the Doo Wop 50 and 51 DVDs, and was anxiously waiting for Rock, Rhythm and Doo Wop to arrive. From the first video, which featured the cr&egrave;me de la cr&egrave;me of the 50s groups, to Doo Wop 51, it was clear that there was a giant leap forward in terms of production. Better lighting, better stage layout, and better sound quality.<br />Sadly, in terms of editing, they went overboard this time. Excessive use of pre-recorded clapping and cheering really irritated me. There are times where you can hardly hear the singing, because the pre-recorded cheering was so loud. Imagine 5 stadiums hosting the Super Bowl all crammed into one theater. It\'s simply too artificial. We want not only the authentic groups, but also the authentic reaction from who was there. And believe me, we don\'t need any extra cheering to get more goosebumps from watching these wonderful groups.<br />For whoever edited the show, I would also be careful with too much filming of the spectators during the songs and make sure to look back at Doo Wop 51 for better camera angles of the groups.<br />Is this DVD worth buying? Definately, because groups/singers Fred Parris &amp; The Satins, Little Anthony &amp; The Imperials, Little Richard, The Limelites, Jerry Butler, Lloyd Price, Bobby Lewis, and the absolutely fantastic Contours make it all worthwhile.<br />I hope TJ Lubinsky keeps on making shows like this, they\'re a wonderful experience for all ages.'),(14,3,'B00006HAXW','Blue Ruin','Professional Excellence','Having worked in television for 34 years I can tell you that this is one of the finest doo-wop DVD\'s you will ever see.

Little Anthony and the Imperials were also very, very good!  They have recaputured the sounds of the music they way we remembered it!  The backup musicians deserve an huge amount of praise.

I recommend it HIGHLY!'),(21,3,'B00006HAXW','Blue Ruin','Another outstanding performance and concert.','As I stated in my reviews for Doo Wop 50 and Doo Wop 51, both they and this show are extremely outstanding in nearly every way.  Frankly, I thought Little Richard\'s appearance was a little pointless, and while I enjoyed Frankie Ford\'s Sea Cruise, both of these performances seemed a little out of place on this show.  It seemed like Lou Christie was straining to hit the high notes at times, but hit them he did. I was especially impressed with Little Anthony and the Imperials acappella performance of \"Two Kinds of People in the World\", and Jay Black and the Americans\' performance of Cara Mia (at the very respectable age of 62) is enough to make the hair on the back of your neck stand up every time you watch it.  I wonder why the back up group Pure Gold, which appears on all three shows, doesn\'t get a performance of their own, because they are good.  This is an excellent addition to anyone\'s DVD library.  Some notes here:  all three of these shows have behind the scenes interviews with various performers.  There are five or six on Doo Wop 50, ten on Doo Wop 51, and ten or twelve on this one, but this is the only one of the three to have bonus tracks of performances, of which there are four.  There is a listing of the tracks on the back of the DVD case, but whoever designed that put them in random order, not as they appear on the DVD.  The performance listing as it appears on the DVD is as follows:<br /><br />Keep A Knocking - Little Richard<br />Sea Cruise - Frankie Ford<br />A Thousand Stars - Kathy Young and the Innocents<br />Silhouettes - The Rays<br />Do You Love Me - Contours<br />Have You Heard and You Belong to Me - Duprees<br />Peppermint Twist - Joey Dee and the Starlighters<br />For Your Love - Ed Townsend<br />Romeo and Juliet - Reflections<br />Lightning Strikes - Lou Christie<br />Tears on My Pillow, Shimmy Shimmy Ko Ko Bop, Two Kins of People in the World, Hurt So Bad, and Going Out of My Head - Little Anthony & the Imperials<br />Since I Fell for You - Lenny Welch<br />Tossing and Turning - Bobby Lewis<br />Mr. Blue and Come Softly to Me - Fleetwoods<br />Remember Then and I Believe - Larry Chance and the Earls<br />Daddy\'s Home - Shep and the Limelighters<br />This Magic Moment and Cara Mia - Jay Black and the Americans<br />He Don\'t Love You (Like I Love You) - Jerry Butler and Pure Gold<br />Stagger Lee - Lloyd Price<br />Once in a While -  Chimes<br />Then You Can Tell Me Goodbye - Casinos<br />To the Aisle and In the Still of the Night - Fred Parris and the Satins<br />Let\'s Hang On - Frankie Valli and cast (end credits)<br />Bonus tracks (can be viewed in any order):<br />Never - Earls<br />My Own True Love -  Duprees<br />Come a Little Bit Closer - Jay Black and the Americans<br />First I Look at the Purse - Contours.'),(22,3,'B00006HAXW','Blue Ruin','Outstanding Whether It Is Either On VHS Or DVD','I own both the VHS and DVD versions of this program, and I second everything the other reviewer wrote.  I used most of these songs in my after school music class with 5th and 6th graders and they love it.  We first sang the songs off lyric sheets and from CD\'s and then watched the DVD.  They enjoyed it so much I ordered a DVD copy for each of my students as a present for joining the class.  I would suggest ordering the DVD version since it has about eight interviews with artists from the program in addition to six extra songs that aren\'t available on the VHS version.  The DVD version is now available only from PBS.  The singers may be older than when they first made these songs hits, but they can still sing them as well as ever.  My only complaint with it is it has five songs by Little Anthony and the Imperials.  Two would have been enough with maybe a second song from some of the other singers in their place.  Nevertheless, you can\'t go wrong with either the VHS or DVD version.  I prefer the DVD since it includes extra songs and interviews that the VHS version doesn\'t have.'),(23,3,'B00004CQT3','The Book Thief','far from home: the adventures of yellow dog','well,this just goes to show why you don\'t blindly accept a critics review.

It is a very heartwarming  story without being predictable and just fantastic views. The heck with critics. Buy this because it makes you feel good and that there wasnt a need for explosions or car chases or guns to provide for interesting viewing.'),(24,4,'B00004CQT3','The Book Thief','Spectacular and suspenseful family film!','The cover of our DVD of \"Far From Home\" says in large letters: \"Family Feature\".  And a great family movie it is.  But don\'t make the mistake of thinking that this is just another dog movie, in this case the adventures of a Labrador named \"Yellow\".  Even more it is about the adventures of his young master Angus.  Angus acquires Yellow when the dog appears on the family property, apparently lost, and soon the boy and his dog become firm friends.  When Angus and Yellow are marooned in wilderness country after the sinking of his father\'s ship, it is their combined strength that is required to survive the rugged coastline, vast forests, and hostile wildlife.<br /><br />Most of the conflict revolves around this very real struggle against the elements, leading up to a suspenseful and heartwarming conclusion.  But along with this suspense comes excellent and convincing characterization.  More than just an adventure story, \"Far From Home\" is ultimately a coming-of-age story, as Angus learns about responsibility and survival.  In the process, his relationships with his father and with his dog are especially well-portrayed.<br /><br />Although the movie is \"clean\", I would not recommend this movie for younger children under 10 mainly because of its capacity to evoke strong emotions of fear (there are some scary moments involving a sinking ship during a storm, a wolf attack, and a perilous log crossing over a ravine) and grief (it\'s hard to hold back the emotions experienced at losing a missing child).  But with this depth of emotion, older children and adults alike will find it a real tear-jerker.  When combined with good acting and some lovely cinematography of beautiful rugged British Columbia, this movie is definitely a drama worth keeping for the family. - GODLY GADFLY'),(25,4,'B00004CQT3','The Book Thief','A truly wonderful family film','I would beg to differ with the above description of the film. This is not the typical &quot;A-boy-and-his-pet&quot; film. The story is more realistic than the typical film of its genre such as &quot;Flipper&quot; or  &quot;Lassie&quot; and lacks the obvious manipulations of an &quot;Air  Bud.&quot; The characters look like real people. (Watch how Angus\' little  brother dresses himself. Anyone who has been around a six-year old can see  their child dressing like this).

I was expecting a family-oriented film that focuses on a teenager and his dog struggling to make it after a terrible boat accident leaves them stranded along the rocky coasts of British Columbia, and the film delivers in that respect but... it just *barely* delivers.<br /><br />The entire presentation feels really bloated and exaggerated to me which is typical of early to mid 90\'s adventure films.  A film that certainly LOOKS really good and I imagine a lot of time was devoted to making it, and I remember back in the mid 90\'s how these type of animal movies won the hearts of everyone who had an affection for them, but as the years pass and technology and filmmaking changes, I find a movie like this just isn\'t very fun to watch anymore.<br /><br />I can\'t remember if this film was produce by Disney but it definitely *feels* like it was.  My biggest problem is that the actual survival story between the teenager and his dog was incredibly shallow.<br /><br />Yes they collect bugs, kill animals when they get hungry enough, encounter dangerous wildlife animals such as wolves and wild cats, but... it\'s just not enough.  These segments feel undeveloped and uncreative.  It\'s just not enough entertainment and doesn\'t offer a darn thing as far as originality is concerned either.  It\'s completely missing anything TRULY enticing.<br /><br />Yes, the parents are worried that their teenage boy is missing.  Interesting though that it never seemed to cross the mind of either those searching for the boy or his parents (with the exception of one scene) that he might be dead.  It was also strange how it was just assumed the boy would make it on land.  I\'d be flying planes over the ocean first.<br /><br />If that was MY son out there missing in the woods, you better believe I\'d fear the worst.  Granted, there was one really good emotional segment where the father looks into a mirror and cries his eyes out while his wife comforts him, but eh... that was just one moment of sincerity surrounded by a subtle belief that the boys life was never *truly* in danger.  Not very appealing or accurate storytelling.<br /><br />The fact the film is barely 75 minutes long is another problem, and even though everyone loves the dramatic and touching ending, I\'ve seen better.  Actually had the entire movie been dramatic and memorable like the ending, it would have been even better.<br /><br />Personally I feel Homeward Bound is a LOT better because that movie utilizes not just a compelling story of animal survival, but humor as well.  A much better movie than this one.'),(31,5,'B00004CQT3','The Book Thief','Amazing','I have no words, really my wife would not stop mourn the end of the movie.intense, surprising, sad, happy, sentimental, inspiring, emotional,'),(32,5,'B00004CQT3','The Book Thief','Dog Lover\'s Will Adore This','Are you a dog lover and into adventure?

It is a little slow at times, especially in the beginning while things are set up.  It is fairly predictable.  But it is entertaining.  Kids will enjoy it more than their parents.  My biggest complaint was actually the short scenes.  Many things are introduced and resolved too quickly, never giving any plot point time to be fully developed.  At the same time, I did eventually get caught up in the emotions and found the ending satisfying.<br /><br />The film could have been much better but does grow on you.

Unfortunately I didn\'t find it quite as satisfying at most of the reviewers.  Can\'t quite put my finger on it, but perhaps I didn\'t find the characters as likeable or convincing as some who saw this.  Even the dog was not that interesting for some reason; perhaps not one of the more attractive breeds.  Also it seemed that they didn\'t spend enough time developing the bond between the boy and the dog. (The movie is short; not even 1 1/2 hours.) It\'s a great family movie and I think it is more suitable for young children than older ones who may find it boring.  The younger ones might be a little upset near the end when the dog can\'t be rescued, but don\'t worry as it has a happy ending.  It\'s an okay movie, but I expected a lot more.  I like movies that BOTH kids and adults can enjoy (like Shrek II).  This is definately one mainly just for the kids.  So many things that kids can\'t or shouldn\'t watch.  This is one that anyone can watch, which is a big plus.  Probably would have been better as a TV movie and would easily fit in a 2-hour timeframe with plenty of time for commercials.'),(46,9,'B00004CQT3','The Book Thief','Truly bad but not the worst','This movie was one of the worst I have ever seen. The acting wasn\'t good, it was very predictable, and some parts of the plot were competly unnecessary. The worst bit of acting was when Yellow comes home, his owner has no expression when he sees him and does not look even remotely happy. If you want predictable, watch a survival movie. What happens, almost always, is a person gets lost in the wilderness in an accident, they struggle to survive, they are found, and then brought home. \"Far From Home\" is no exception. As for unnecessary, the whole \"romance\" part of this movie was badly done and not needed. The girl gives him cookies and kisses him when he comes home, and all the while, the boy of her affections remains pretty much obtuse. Also some parts of this movie might upset young children, such as the time he kills a rabbit and when Yellow can\'t be rescued. All in all, I would not advise anyone to see this movie; in fact, I would warn against it.'),(47,10,'B00004CQT4','Borgman','Who\'s the man','It is a funny movie, but I think there is way too much cursing, it takes away from the movie....'),(48,7,'B00004CQT4','Borgman','Who\'s the Man','It\'s a comedy who done it, featuring alot of the old school hip-hop artists.

The first part of the film strains for epic grandeur with its story of two orphans being trained in the art and honor of the Chinese opera (not the singing kind). One of the boys sees his family slaughtered in a political maneuver but is saved from imminent death by a wandering opera master and his charge. The three form a offbeat family unit which is threatened when their master is humiliated in a challenge with a Southern rival. The movie fast forwards until the boys are grown and ready to seek a form of retribution as they move into the popular Shanghai opera scene in the twenties. After this simple story is resolved, the second half of the film becomes a loopy bit of revenge fantasy. The screenplay twists and turns as secrets are revealed, implausibilities mount up, and characters have their ulterior motives exposed. It is chaotic (and tries way too hard), but at least it\'s fun.<br /><br />Many who have unfavorably judged \"My Kingdom\" tend to proclaim the first half as brilliant and the second half as the weak link. I, however, tend to disagree. I thought that the introductory premise was so thin and contrived that I never bought into the dramatic substance of the plot. Heck, two seconds after the boys arrive in Shanghai, they are greeted by a street parade extolling an upcoming performance of the man who bested their adoptive father 15 years previously. Hey, that was simple. These two vagabonds issue a challenge to the opera superstar that somehow gets newspaper coverage and makes them headliners in a opera duel. Hey, that was simple too. Now they are legends! Wow, that\'s a lot for their first day in town! After the duel, the boys must integrate themselves within the existing opera company that includes a defiant leading lady. As one steps into the spotlight and an illicit affair, the other seeks to avenge his family\'s murder from so many years ago. The remainder of the film plays as a twisty thriller that never feels particularly real. But as the convoluted plotting wraps around itself, I must admit to being amused by it all. It, for me, was far more entertaining than what had preceded it.<br /><br />The movie itself is elaborately staged. The battle sequences and opera numbers have a pleasing over-the-top quality. 1920\'s Shanghai is lush and gorgeous and the costuming is memorable. However, it all feels a little flat. The leads are attractive enough, but they lack a gravitas to convince us they can headline an intended epic. I understand they are known pop stars in their country, and that makes sense. The actor who plays a diabolical police investigator seems like he\'s about twelve and downplays the drama out of every scene. Ultimately, I think \"My Kingdom\" tries to accomplish too much. I personally wish they would have committed to making it an adult soap opera with no pretensions other than to entertain. As is, it\'s a bit of a mess. I probably liked it for the wrong reasons, but its loopiness is not without its charms. KGHarris, 1/12.'),(54,8,'B0078V2LCY','Captain Phillips','My Kingdom','Very good movie.

This is the exception. Great, believable characters. Excellent character development. And some sword play and action to keep the men in your life interested.'),(83,12,'B000063W1R','Frozen','One of the best adventure movies ever','Start with great material like the classic book this film is based on, use a great director, pick great locations, assemble an incredible cast mixing well known with newer actors, and then adapt the book in a brilliant screenplay, and you end up with a movie like this that is everything a movie should be.  Adventure, mystery, romance, action sequences, character and plot development, and humor are all combined into a masterpiece.<br /><br />The 1,000 page book by Dumas is, of course, a beloved classic with the theme of what would perfect revenge be like.  The book has complicated twists and a darker tone with an ending that feels like a let down in many ways.  Incredibly, the screenplay manages to summarize the book and include enough adaptations and a much more positive ending.  I can\'t say enough good about this screenplay and how well this movie adapts an intricate novel that would be impossible to film if you kept strictly to the plot of the novel.  The screenplay is perfectly balanced.  If you have watched several current adventure movies where the lighting is so dark, the action so blurred, the characters so poorly developed, and the plot so weak that you aren\'t even sure who you are watching and why they are doing whatever it is they are doing on the screen, you will appreciate the pacing of this film with clear lighting and a sound track that even grandfather can understand.<br /><br />The acting is perfect with no grandiloquent flourishes but enough idiosyncracy that each character seems perfectly drawn.  Caviezel just couldn\'t be better as the lead character Dantes who is betrayed by his best friend who marries his girlfriend and sends him to prison for life.  Dantes meets a wise prisoner with knowledge of a hidden fortune, played by the late Richard Harris, and eventually escapes and wreaks a carefully plotted revenge on each and every enemy who had wronged him.<br /><br />Without giving any more of the plot away, let me just say that this is the way movies should be and that the whole family will love this movie and watch it again and again as mine has.<br /><br />Available in several formats, and for a great price since this movie has been out for nearly 10 years, I definitely recommend this movie highly.  Five stars.'),(84,12,'B000063W1R','Frozen','AWESOME','I have to say I was so impressed with this movie.

The cast is okay, though I think the woman playing Mercedes needed to do a better job of enunciating.

How could this super-long drama be fit into two hours? This film did that misson-impossible task. Compared with French TV-series starring Gerald Depardieu as the Count of Monte Cristo, first half of the story is well depicted, while the latter part is too brief. There is no Valentine nearly poisoned by her step mother, no Haydee, former Turk princess. And the story depends too much on duels so it is more visually described than the original story\'s deliberate revenge plan. But the relief is that Albert\'s role is spared and is given a huge part in this drama.<br /><br />Verdict: Monte Cristo for Young Adults<br />Rating: 70 out of 100.

Anyways, the acting is so-so, Caviezel plays Dantes as a whiny little brat, Guy Pearce acts like an evil gremlin, and the end ends happily as hollywood must, tho it makes the story more lame.

And there\'s no question that this film adequately and entertainingly captures the tale of revenge. What it lacks is the intricacy of Dumas\'s work, which really captures the meticulous planning and plotting that go into the protagonist\'s desire for vengeance. I cannot fault the film too much, as the level of detail required might have made this 2 hr. film much, much longer, which can be a fault, unto itself.

Yes, Edmond Dantes is wrongly imprisoned and meets someone there that helps him get out and rain misfortunes down on those who were responsible for his time in the Chateau d\'If. That\'s pretty much where the similarities end. The methods of revenge in the movie are much less imaginative, basically consisting of him telling them he is Dantes and then killing them. These replace Dumas\' genius methods - economic ruin, mental insanity, suicide, etc.<br /><br />However, if you don\'t want to commit to reading a 1500 page book, and can\'t devise a way to see the play adaptation, you will never know the differences, and this is a good movie.

We used the theme of revenge vs forgiveness as a discussion tool. It was also refreshing to see a movie with positive references to God and still be exciting.  We are going to read the book this summer, and We don\'t expect the book and the movie to be exactly the same.  They are two different expressions.'),(119,17,'B000063W1R','Frozen','Amazing film - but with a couple of minor glitches','I\'ll admit, I\'ve not read the original source novel on which this is based (the only thing by Dumas I have read, is the classic \'Musketeers\'); life is too short to read every great novel, try as one might - but having seen this film, I am determined to seek out the text.<br /><br /> Judging the film on its own terms, I found this immensely satisfying, and though quite long (131 min), it does not drag for a second. The story itself is really quite something, and no matter how many films you have seen, or books you have read, you will be absolutely bowled over (as George Bernard Shaw was) by the breadth, depth, simplicity and universality of it.<br /><br /> There are some minor faults with the film; sometimes the dialogue seems a little stilted (eg. Guy Pearce, an Australian who has mastered a range of accents, seems a little too much of a cookie-cutter villain: Daniel Day-Lewis did a much better job in \'Gangs of New York\'). There is something faintly unsatisying about the conclusion, no matter how memorable it may be - but even compared with \'Barry Lyndon\' (Kubrick), this is still a riveting, assured adaptation.<br /><br /> These are very minor quibbles, and I would put this in with some of my favourite films, along with \'Captain Blood\' (Errol Flynn), \'Koyanisquaatsi\', \'New Cinema Paradiso\' and \'Celebration\' (aka Festen). Generally, the script is absolutely top notch, full of little throw-away quips and putdowns. The cast is absolutely stunning, especially James Calaziel, absolutely convincing in his metamorphosis from naive youth to cold-blooded avenger. Watch out for Luis Guizman as a scheming pirate.<br /><br /> Very highly recommended, for those who seek something a little more high-brow than the standard multiplex schlock.'),(120,17,'B000063W1R','Frozen','a nice adaptation of Dumas\'s clasic novel','A film by Kevin Reynolds<p>This is the recent film adaptation of Dumas\'s classic novel \"The Count of Monte Cristo\".  From the previews and early reviews of the movie I did not expect too much from it, but when someone whose opinion I trust tells me that it is good and that I should watch it, I was willing to give it a chance.  Good thing, because this is a pretty good movie.  <p>The story, if you are not familiar with the source material, follows Edmond Dantes (Jim Caviezel).  Dantes, in the film, is a sailor and the film opens with Dantes and his friend Fernand Mondego (Guy Pierce) trying find refuge on an island because their captain is dying.  The island just happens to be the prison island where Napoleon is exiled, and while they get help, Napoleon asks Dantes if he could take a personal, and innocent, letter to a friend.  Dantes agrees.  Dantes returns to France and does not have a chance to deliver the letter, though we do see his fianc&eacute; Mercedes Iguanada (Dagmara Dominczyk) and a little bit of Mondego\'s jealousy.  Dantes is betrayed and turned into the authorities for treason.  That innocent letter that Dantes was to deliver was not so innocent after all.  The magistrate has Dantes thrown in prison where he will spend the next several years.  <p>This is where the movie truly begins.  Dantes was innocent and he was betrayed (we soon learn that Mondego is now married to Mercedes), and he wants his revenge, though he has no avenue to pursue his revenge while in prison.  While in prison, Dantes meets Abbe Faria (Richard Harris), a man who is digging a tunnel (slowly, inch by inch) to escape.  Faria trains Dantes in the sword, teaches him how to read, science, literature, politics, and how to be a noble.  He also tells Dantes of a treasure, the treasure of Monte Cristo, that may or may not exist.  <p>We wouldn\'t have a story if Dantes is unable to escape or pursue his revenge, so I\'m not spoiling anything by revealing that.  Dantes sets himself up as the Count of Monte Cristo with the help of a man named Jacopo (Luis Guzman).  Dantes is now free to pursue his revenge.  <p>The story feels like it has been simplified a little bit, but this film is good enough, and slick enough, and entertaining enough, that this is a very enjoyable movie to watch.  No film can ever capture the nuance of a novel, especially not a 1000 page novel.  With the amount of time allotted this film, \"The Count of Monte Cristo\" succeeds at being an entertaining film.'),(121,18,'B000063W1R','Frozen','Great...until the ending','I read the \'Monte Cristo\' book a few months before the movie came out and I adored it, so I was really pumped up to see it on screen. First off, the actors were perfectly casted and the director did a great job adapting the book to film. BUT,I have to take points off for the ending. Whenever a book is made into a movie, the plot is tweaked and molded to be more entertaining visually. My issue was not just that the ending was changed, it was the COMPLETE OPPOSITE of what happened in the book! It was totally ridiculous! It was exactly what you would expect to happen, even though it was totally unrealistic. That\'s why I gave it only three stars. If you\'re speaking in terms of overall cinematic experience, it\'s a wonderful film. I suggest that you read the book first, see the movie, and judge for yourself. Or if you\'ve already seen the film, go read the book anyway and see what you missed.'),(122,18,'B000063W1R','Frozen','Great Job','Most of the older style movies really turn me off, but not this one.

Some of the things are a little predictable, but it is hard not to want to make sure that your hopes come true. You can feel yourself cringe and want to shout &quot;don\'t do this&quot; or &quot;don\'t do that&quot; or &quot;get\'em&quot;.<p>The cinematography is very good and appropriate.

Immediately my mind shot back to last year\'s \"The Musketeer,\" also based (rather loosely, I might add) on another of Alexandre Dumas\' famous classics. In that film, character development, story, and tone were sacrificed for the sake of creating yet another movie in which a choreographer of Chinese descent was allowed to make an impression on action aficionados by dazzling them with techniques reminiscent of \"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.\" <p>What a relief that this latest adaptation of a Dumas novel strays from the usual clich&eacute;s and redundancy of bringing a classic work of literature to the screen, coming out as a sturdy, well-guided costume drama that combines action, intensity, passion, and most importantly, revenge. With a script that keeps much of the novel\'s intricacies intact, a cast befitting of their roles, and a director who keeps things interesting at all times, this is one swashbuckling adventure that pleases in all fields. <p>The story centers around Edmund Dantes (Jim Caviezel), a sailor from a middle class upbringing in the town of Marseilles. He has a friend, Fernand Mondego (Guy Pearce), whose father is a wealthy aristocrat; despite his rich lifestyle, Mondego still harbors a slight jealousy for Dantes, who has just been promoted to captain of his vessel, allowing him the opportunity to marry his longtime love, Mercedes (Dagmara Dominczyk). Overcome by envy, Mondego concocts a vicious plan with the equally jealous first mate of Dantes\' boat that lands a wrongfully accused Dantes in the Chateau d\'If for more than a decade.<p>During his years of imprisonment, Dantes\' resolve is strengthened by brutal beatings, and by his friendship with fellow prisoner Faria (Richard Harris), who teaches Dantes to read and write, the articulate moves of swordplay, and offers him the location of a long-lost treasure that would give him the means to exact his revenge on those who have wronged him. Faria\'s death provides Dantes the method of escape he needs, and once out, he begins his quest. <p>The second half of the movie takes the movie to new heights of interest, as Dantes makes his big entrance in Paris as the Count of Monte Cristo, bent on exacting his revenge on Mondego, now married to a repressed, sullen Mercedes, and on Villefort, the police chief who played a role in his wrongful incarceration. Anyone familiar with revenge plots is well aware that this is a dish best served cold, and many will delight in the cooly calculated revelations and confrontations that arise as Dantes\'s master plan begins to unfold. <p>Accompanying this feeling of satisfaction is the movie\'s wondrous appearance and execution. The look and feel of the film drips with the quality of the swashbuckling adventures of yesteryear, with its themes of vengeance and nobility, it\'s glorious costumes and set design, and a final showdown that provides a slam-bang finish complete with suspense and fist-clenching thrills. Reynolds, and screenwriter Jay Wolpert, have realized the novel for the screen in a manner that is pleasing to the eye and the mind, keeping in touch with everything that has immortalized Dumas\' work without reworking key moments to make room for modern artistic influences.<p>If this weren\'t enough to please popcorn audiences and literary buffs, the cast is completely remarkable. Jim Caviezel plays Dantes with the conviction of a man wrongfully accused; by the time he escapes prison, we are all for him and his brilliantly conceived plan. His chemistry with leading lady Dagmara Dominczyk is a welcome slice of old-fashioned romance, while his scenes with Guy Pearce provide a nice contrast of nobility and jealousy, which Pearce perfects in his performance as Mondego. Also worthy of noting are the appearances of Richard Harris and Lius Guzman, who provide humorous touches throughout. <p>More than anything else, this latest big-screen version of \"The Count of Monte Cristo\" is a wonderful popcorn adventure replete with everything you could possibly ask for in a film of this sort. Overall, it remains faithful enough to its source, and keeps us enlightened and entertained throughout its well-acted, well-directed, well-executed duration. Count on revenge, and then some.'),(136,24,'B000063W1R','Frozen','A surprisingly fresh and superb adventure film','In this time of fire and explosion oriented blockbuster movies it is indeed refreshing to find a remake of a classic novel of the quality of The Count of Monte Cristo currently available.  I happened to nonchalantly choose this film at the DVD outlet as a source of viewing background for an evening of desk work.  WRONG!  This superbly made film of the Dumas\' novel is excellent and gripping on every level.  The quality of the film, shot in Ireland and Malta, is visually stunning, the story remains true to the original, and the cast is outstanding.  James Caviezel makes a star turn in the title role, aided by the always excellent Guy Pearce, the veteran Richard Harris, the here venomous James Frain, a fine and very different role for Luis Guzman, and the elegantly beautiful Dagmara Domincyzk.  The movie is beautifully paced, the long prison scenes allow Caviezel and Harris to create tremendous rapport, and the age old theme of REVENGE has rarely been played out so well.  This is a beautiful period piece, finely photographed and scored and edited and directed.  For a taste of just how exciting the old tales can be visually, treat yourself to an evening with The Count!'),(137,17,'B000063W1R','Frozen','Not the Story, but Enjoyable Nontheless','If you have never discovered the wonderful world of Alexandre Dumas, I urge you to run, not walk to the local library or bookstore and obtain a copy of \"Le Comte de Monte Christo.\" I also recommend reading the unabridged version of this classic tale about a man who takes revenge on his enemies. One thing is certain: do not attempt to take the lazy way out by watching this adaptation of Dumas\'s novel. Two hours will never be enough time to adequately express the majestic beauty of this novel written by a phenomenal storyteller. Having said that, I enjoyed immensely this version of the story starring Jim Caviezel, Guy Pearce, and Richard Harris. Period pieces are often fun to watch, and this one is no exception. With a few problematic exceptions, \"The Count of Monte Christo\" is an entertaining film.<p>The tale, if you are not familiar with it, focuses on a French sailor named Edmond Dantes. On a trading trip back to Marseilles, Dantes had the misfortune to stop at the island of Elba, the home of the exiled emperor Napoleon Bonaparte. With his captain dead, Dantes arrives in port and is promptly promoted to become the new captain. This step up in status angers several people around Dantes, specifically Danglars, Villefort, and Mondego. The three conspire to have Edmond arrested on charges of treason and thrown into a political prison called the Chateau D\'If. Dantes spends years suffering in solitary confinement, although he eventually meets an elderly prisoner named Faria who educates him while they plan their escape. Moreover, this prisoner tells Edmond about a fabulous treasure that could be his for the taking. Eventually, Dantes escapes and embarks on a series of adventures that finds him returning to seek revenge against his enemies under the name \"Le Comte de Monte Christo.\"<p>This very short description of Dumas\'s novel obviously leaves out much of the plot. It also highlights the inherent difficulties in translating \"The Count of Monte Christo\" into a two-hour film. There is just too much detail, characters, and sub-plots in the novel to work with. The revenge plots Dantes formulates against his enemies alone are of such length and complexity that it would take hours to encapsulate them on the silver screen. Throw in the sub-plot of the Italian bandit Luigi Vampa (who does appear in the film), which is of immense importance in the novel, and it is impossible to adequately convey the full majesty of this classic on celluloid. Fortunately, this film manages to entertain while retaining key elements of the written story.<p>The first part of the movie hews closely to the novel with a few notable exceptions. The film begins with Edmond and his friend Mondego landing on Elba, where they have a shoot out with British security forces before personally meeting the deposed emperor. Back in Marseilles, we meet Mercedes, Dantes girlfriend and a character who plays a big role in the written story. The filmmakers do insert a warden for Chateau D\'If, played by actor Michael Wincott, who does not appear in the book. If you are familiar with Wincott, you will remember his voice and his presence. He makes a great addition here and has the best lines in the film. <p>By the time Dantes returns to society as the Count, the film diverges wildly from the story. The revenge Edmond seeks here is too pat and too easily resolved. In the book, his vengeance is intricately planned and executed slowly over many, many pages. By shortening this sequence, the filmmakers sacrifice the suspense of the novel to time constraints and a waning attention span common in today\'s moviegoers. To be fair, the movie never tries to be a literal interpretation of the book (or so says screenwriter Jay Wolpert in an interview on the disc). In some ways, deviating from the book does make the story more compelling. The sword fights are great fun to watch, especially the final showdown between Dantes and Mondego. The scene where Dantes provides a way out for Villefort and then pulls back at the last second is a nice touch as well. Overall, although I think more elements of the book should have been kept in the story, the movie succeeds.<p>Many extras on the disc make this well worth picking up. There is a short documentary about Alexandre Dumas, a location documentary, four deleted scenes with commentary, a film commentary from director Kevin Reynolds, a detailed explanation on how the sword fights were shot and choreographed, and an interview with writer Jay Wolpert. The picture quality and sound is top notch. I recall that this film disappeared from the theaters quickly, perhaps due to an aversion for period pieces or competition from one of those effects laden clunkers they foist on us every few months. I found \"The Count of Monte Christo\" entertaining and technically well done, and would certainly view it again.'),(138,18,'B000063W1R','Frozen','A spirited adventure.','This most recent adaptation of Alexandre Dumas\' classic novel isn\'t going to please all the fans, particularly those who demand rigorous adherence to the source material (I never did understand such people\'s way of thinking; a movie is never bad just because it strays from the source) but it most certainly will please moviegoers in the mood for a period piece adventure, and as such a film, The Count of Monte Cristo never fails to entertain for every bit of its running time. <p>Jim Caviezel stars as Edmond Dantes, a rather poor and uneducated man who has a life that his rich friend, Fernand Mondego (Guy Pearce) envies. Dantes has just been promoted to captain of his ship after he and his crew returned from a brief, unanticipated stop in Elba, where Napoleon had given Dantes a letter to give to a \"friend.\" Mondego is particularly jealous that Dantes\' fiancee is Mercedes (Dagmara Dominczyk), their childhood friend who has grown into an utterly beautiful woman. <p>Mondego sets out to destroy Dantes life by telling French officials of the letter, which leads to Dantes\' arrest. He is banished in a prison located on an island rather far from the mainland. As the years pass, another prisoner, Faria (Richard Harris), actually tunnels his way into Dantes cell. With his help, Faria believes they can dig to the outer wall, and in return, he will teach Dantes how to read, write, and fight with a sword. As soon as he makes his escape, Dantes plans his vengeance against those who betrayed him.<p>There\'s actually a LOT more plot than what I\'ve stated, which probably already sounds hefty, but there are a lot of things I\'d rather not give away. While not without some flaws, The Count of Monte Cristo is rousing entertainment and is probably the best period piece adventure in recent years (personally, I found it more enjoyable than The Patriot, Rob Roy, and The Last of the Mohicans). <p>The film\'s first seventy minutes represent marvelous entertainment, consistently gaining momentum with every scene that goes by as we grow more and more compelled by the story. The film stumbles only slightly in the third act, when Dantes eventually encounters all those who destroyed his life so many years ago, and sets in motion a plan for his own vengeance. It\'s in this lengthy segment that a few moments drag (but only a few) and some scenes feel a little hard to swallow (that Pearce\'s Mondego wouldn\'t recognize Dantes). The climax feels a little silly, in that seemingly all the lead characters pop out from nowhere to either fight or reveal long-held secrets. <p>But thankfully, such flaws are only mild and hardly detrimental. This is a well-acted, well-written, and surprisingly well-directed tale of revenge. As Dantes, Caviezel excels, making a believable transformation from a kind-hearted, innocent man to one whose heart has been hardened through so many years. Guy Pearce chews the scenery quite well as Mondego; he seems to be having a great time playing the greedy antagonist. It\'s nice to see that Pearce, who usually plays likable characters (as in L.A. Confidential and The Time Machine), is up to the task of giving us a villain to hiss at. <p>The other performances aren\'t quite as vital, though Richard Harris is good as Faria, and Luis Guzman is often hilarious as Dantes\' right-hand man (the scene where Guzman tells Dantes how to handle the massive amounts of gold they just found is the biggest laugh I\'ve had all year). Dagmara Dominczyk is pretty decent, though her acting is mostly overshadowed by her beauty, a back-handed compliment, I suppose.<p>The Count of Monte Cristo actually doesn\'t feature that much in the way of adrenaline-pumping action. Despite all the claims this is a swashbuckler, there are only three swordfights (and one knifefight), and each of these scenes last no longer than maybe two minutes. But the appeal of this film isn\'t in the action, it\'s watching a plot that unfolds with little twists and turns that, though often expected, engaged me because I cared about the situation and the fate of the characters.<p>There was obviously a lot of work put into the way this film looks. The cinematography is gorgeous and the sets are magnificent, with splendor I have rarely seen rendered so well in period pieces. The film was directed by Kevin Reynolds, who may yet have a career again after his critical disaster, Waterworld (which actually wasn\'t half-bad). Highly recommended, The Count of Monte Cristo is great fun all the way.<br />**** 1/2 out of *****'),(139,7,'B000063W1R','Frozen','The Count reigns down revenge','Not since Mask Of Zorro have we had an old fashioned revenge movie that played on classic cinema rather than tendency of movies today to be loud and bloody. I was fortunate to see this movie with a sneak preview audience. <p>James Caviezel is fantastic in the role of the Count. He is very believeable as a simple, humble man in the beginning and then the torn, angry, revenge seeking Count later on. The movie has many similar elements to the aforementioned Mask Of Zorro, but has enough of its own identity for you to note the similarities, but not be distracted by them. The beautiful actress Dagmara Domincyzk plays the love interest. There are many closeups of her face and she is stunningly beautiful and convincing. Guy Pearce is a more than able bad guy, successfully creating a character that you come to despise thoroughly by the end. <p>The audience that I viewed this with absolutely loved it. There are sprinkles of light comedic lines throughout the film and the audience was delighted with them all. The scenes where the Count is exacting his revenge registered the loudest response from the audience, as many were very vocal in their approval of the revenge being dished out.<p>It had been a while since I viewed a movie where the audience broke into a loud ovation at the end. This one received such an ovation and I concur.'),(140,8,'B000063W1R','Frozen','James Caviezel leads the way in a solid MONTE CRISTO','Alexandre Dumas\' classic adventure novel of revenge and romance, THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO has been endlessly made and remade in various films and TV series.  It\'s no wonder as the book\'s themes of betrayal and payback are timeless.  Kevin Reynolds directs a solid and full blooded version of this classic that features a star-making turn by James Caviezel in the title role.  Caviezel never hits a false note in his role of Edmond Dantes, the sailor sent to prison on trumped-charges and who eventually escapes to seek his revenge on the 3 men who conspired against him.  Caviezel easily handles both the innocence of the young Dantes and the bitter cynicism of his vengeful alter-ego. Richard Harris, who is making a cottage-industry of playing quirky supporting roles, provides warmth and humor as the Abbe\' Faria, the fellow prisoner who mentors Dantes. Dagmara Domincyzk is lovely as Mercedes, Edmond\'s fiancee.  However, Guy Pearce, who plays Dantes\' romantic rival and former friend is a little too over-the-top with his mincing and sneering portrayal.  At one point, I began thinking he needed a top hat, handlebar mustache and cape to complete the picture.<br />  Filmed on location in opulent locations in Malta and Ireland, THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO is a feast for the eyes.  At one point, the Count makes a grand entrance in a hot-air balloon that clearly illustrates his power and mystery.<br />  The screenplay is a solid enough adapation of the rather long novel, although it does throw in a couple twists that were not in the original.  After Dantes appears in his Count identity, the pace of the film really takes off as plotlines are shortened and tightened. The action scenes are also top-notch.<br />  THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO is an entertaining and fun swashbucklng type of flick that they just don\'t make any more. As such, it is easily the best film of this genre since THE MASK OF ZORRO which, in an ironic twist, also used elements of Dumas\' novel. I definitely would recommend this film to adventure lovers and romantics everywhere.'),(141,4,'B000063W1R','Frozen','A Good Film-But Not the True \"Count\"','The Count of Monte Cristo by Alexandre Dumas is one of the great adventure novels of all time, and one would think that it would be the perfect story for an adventure/supense/period film.  Indeed, Kevin Reynold\'s version is the latest in a long line (the Hallmark televised version may be the best).  Sadly, none of them have done the written work justice.  True, the novel is a complex and detailed work that would require a rather special treatment on the screen. Reynold\'s version is a good movie, but honestly it is not \"The Count of Monte Cristo.\"  Far too much dramatic license has been taken here in changing the story, the characters and the ending.  Significant characters were left out, parts of the story are not even aluded to, and some things were added to create a \"hollywood\" ending (no, the book ends much differently than this film...and it is far more satisfying).  This film is nicely photographed and produced and is largely well acted (except for the portrayl of Napoleon which does not work...oddly enough Napoleon is never actually \"seen\" in the novel, he is always off-stage, so to speak).  Enjoy this film for what it is, then treat yourself and pick up a copy of the novel.'),(142,5,'B000063W1R','Frozen','BREATHTAKING...THEY JUST DON\'T MAKE \'EM LIKE THIS ANYMORE','Like the previous reviewer, I too was fortunate enough to catch this last Tuesday at a sneak preview in NY.

But at the same time it\'s an exciting, action-packed, plot AND character driven story during which any viewer with a heart and a soul will be on the edge of his or her seat.  JIM CAVAZIEL, if there is justice in this world, will become a HUGE A-list leading man as a result of his BRILLIANT performance. No other actor out there could have played the Count in this movie; he was made for this, his role of a lifetime, and he deserves an OSCAR FOR IT.

However I am not a literalist when it comes to Hollywood, because movies are not a literary medium. The best we can hope is that Hollywood captures the essence of the book, which I believe the makers of the Count of Monte Christo have done - and done very well.  While I agree that it is not a faithful retelling of Dumas\' original, it is a fine film that captures the heart of Dumas\' message: Vengeance is, (and should be) the Lord\'s. <p>Ultimately, Dumas\' novel was about the ravages of revenge, both to the avenger and to his victims. Director Kevin Reynolds and screenwriter Jay Wolpert\'s celluloid rendition captures that message in a way that is both entertaining and beautiful. Unlike many Hollywood films these days, this one has charm and heart, which allowed me (an avid movie buff) to overlook its occasional imperfections. <p>Jim Caviezal plays the tortured Count with aplomb. His metamorphosis from guileless youth into the brooding, devilish Count is convincing. No small feat considering young and old Dant&egrave;s are polar opposites. <p>Guy Pearce plays the treacherous libertine, Mondego, with a light, foppish touch, making the character all the more frightening. His lines are the best in the film, vicious and manipulative, but delivered with sardonic self-composure.  <p>Richard Harris was the right choice for the Abb&eacute; Faria. During Dant&egrave;s\' bleak imprisonment, Harris lightens the screen with his earnest optimism and sharp wit. He is more animated than in his recent role as Dumbledore in Harry Potter, even fencing with Caviezal, despite his advanced age. <p>Dagmara Dominczyk is lovely as Mercedes, but of course lacks the vapid self-immolation of the character in the novel. Hollywood loves tidy endings so she is reunited with Dant&egrave;s while the Persian princess, Haidee, (Dant&egrave;s\' real paramour at the end of the novel) is not in the film.  Still, Dominczyk\'s elegant grace is winning, despite the weepy dialogue she is sapped with. She and Caviezal are what movie stars should look like. <p>Luis Guzm&aacute;n is fun as the Count\'s dutiful sidekick, Jacopo. Not surprisingly, he is the film\'s comic relief and acts as a bridge between our generation and Napoleonic France. His lines are more modern slang than classical prose, but it works, especially with Guzm&aacute;n\'s East L.A. lilt. <p>Reynold\'s and Wolpert had no easy task - adapting one of the world\'s favorite stories to the Big Screen.  Of course, the novel is a much more complex and philosophical work than the film, and that is to be expected. A true adaptation would likely be 4-5 hours long. And, yes, they have taken liberties with the book - the ending especially. Still, the movie stands on its own as a stirring and inspiring tale of treachery, romance, revenge, and repentance. It is one of my favorite movies ever, and that\'s saying something, since I hate almost everything. Buy it. You won\'t be disappointed.'),(144,10,'B000063W1R','Frozen','Fantastic Swashbuckling Tail','This is definetly not Dumas Count of Monte Cristo. It doesn\'t follow the book close at times and is far fetched from it at others. It is however a great movie and a great way to introduce this young generation to Dumas.<p>The Count of Monte Cristo tells the tale of Edmund Dantes. A man that is imprisoned for a crime by his best friend Fernand Mondego that he did not commit. He spends 13 years in jail at the Chateau\'If.(thats not how you spell it but it\'s close enough for me) It\'s there that Edmund meets a fellow prisonman that trains him in literature, economics, and swordplay. Dantes gets out of jail then goes a spree for revenge to get the men who put him jail.<p>This is a great story of revenge. Jim Cavaziel is perfects as Dantes. He does a great job. He has a swagger and plays Edmund great when he poor and when he\'s rich. He shows his abilities as a good actor because of the different levels to the character. I\'m really impressed with him and hope to see him more in the future.<p>Guy Pearce is good as Fernadn Mondego. I was first impressed with Pearce in L.A. Confidential. It\'s good to see him finally showing his acting abilities again. He plays a great bad guy.

Having recently indulged in this forgotten gem once again, I\'m finding myself kind of giddy.<br /><br />This movie is fun.<br /><br />If you are into the classic adventure films like `Swiss Family Robinson\' and `Robinson Caruso\', this film is right up there and certainly just as engaging.<br /><br />You know, my initial dislike for this movie was probably plagued by a heavy dose of bias.  My parents lauded it, and so that is usually sparks an initial reaction of discomfort.  I mean, I pride myself on having better cinematic taste than they do, and so when they recommend something to me I\'m usually hesitant.  Still, they saw the movie twice in the theater and encouraged me to accompany them on their THIRD trip to the movies.  I begrudgingly accepted the invitation.  Now, mind you, I don\'t think that Guy Pearce or Jim Caviezel are great actors.  Capable, yes, but no where near `great\'.  I think that also clouded my appreciation for this film.<br /><br />I was also merely sixteen when this film was released, so I kind of have an excuse for judging films with sharp bias.<br /><br />Still, I did enjoy the film enough to buy it later on a whim and I\'ve watched it several times since then.  Upon my most recent viewing I found the film elevating drastically for me.<br /><br />The film tells the tale of Edmond Dantes, a middleclass sailor whose friend, the wealthy Fernand Mondego, is surprisingly jealous of Edmond\'s good fortune.  He has recently been promoted to captain of his vessel and has become engaged to his girlfriend, the ravishing Mercedes.  Spurned on by his jealousy, Fernand betrays his friend, concocting an elaborate and viscous scheme that lands Dantes imprisoned in the torturous Chateau d\'If.  While in prison he bonds with a fellow prisoner who teaches him to fight, as well as articulating him, teaching him to read and write and converse as a gentleman.  Then he informs him of a hidden treasure and tells him the location.  Once Edmond finds a means of escape he uses his newfound knowledge to create a disguise, allowing him to exact revenge on the men responsible for his loss of thirteen years in prison.<br /><br />With ravishing and passionate performances, stunning visual prowess and a sharply constructed script that breathes an air of believability in a premise that is undoubtedly far-fetched, `The Count of Monte Cristo\' is nothing short of grade-A entertainment and serves as further proof that first impressions aren\'t always correct.'),(182,37,'B000063W1R','Frozen','Great Customer Service','Arrived quickly and excellently packaged.

But what I will say is, if you enjoy seeing the enemy get no mercy -not necessarily getting killed- and thriving for vengeance at its best with witty `traps\', then there is no exception for you to miss out on this movie.'),(184,37,'B000063W1R','Frozen','A fun and absorbing movie...','While this film may not make it into the \"classic\" category, I\'ve surely seen a lot of movies which were much, much worse.  This one is colorful, well-acted, and tries its very best to do justice to the sprawling plot of Alexandre Dumas\' 1200-page novel.<br /><br />Of course, as any screenwriter has learned, it\'s not just difficult but impossible to shoehorn a huge novel into a film.  Therefore, entire swathes of the novel\'s plot wind up in the waste-basket, characters are blended together, and so on.  The one alteration I found most interesting was the story of the grand love affair between the Count (Edmond Dantes) and Mercedes.  In the novel, the two lovers face up to the decades of betrayal and part ways.  As I recall, Mercedes retires to the country or goes into a convent, while Edmond frees his \"Greek slave\" and marries her.  In this movie, Edmond and Mercedes forgive one another and go on to perpetual bliss. (There is no \"Greek slave\" --- she wound up in the wastebasket with all the other stuff, including the lesbian runaways.)<br /><br />I really think (and hope) that this whole business of turning novels into movies is going to learn something from Peter Jackson\'s \"Lord of the Rings\" --- or from the TV mini-series.  Producers should STOP chopping and maiming the original story to cram it into a narrow time frame: they should take just as much time as needed to tell the complete story.<br /><br />Of course, that\'s just me sayin\'.  :-)<br /><br />This is a good movie!

I have read the book and I loved it.<br /><br />However, that being said, this movie, standing alone, is AMAZING. I cannot complain. Every time I watch it, reading is the last thing from my mind. This has all the elements of a good action movie- a fantastic intrigue, believable and fun characters, lots of exciting twists and turns and action sequences, a solid and sweet romance, revenge, sword fights, smugglers, mercenaries... I could just go on and on.<br /><br />I have seen this movie so many times and will watch it so many times again. I wish Hollywood could make more movies like THIS one. I rarely get to see a good old-fashioned historical epic that I love like this.<br /><br />I refuse to dislike it because it\'s so different than the book. I think it\'s an interesting and modern take on a classic story of revenge. I feel the SPIRIT of the novel the entire time I watch the movie, and that\'s what matters to me.<br /><br />I just want to say this movie had an EXCELLENT cast and I think that\'s what helped make the movie so amazing for me. It was the delivery of the lines and the timing of the actors that made it glide so smoothly. I felt like the ACTORS believed the story and were really committed.<br /><br />In a small but much-needed part, Michael Wincott is perfect in his role as the prison overseer. I love him as an addition to any movie I\'ve seen him in (this role reminded me of his part as Sir Guy in Robin Hood- another amazing part). Of course, Richard Harris as Priest was as perfect as over and very animated! Guy Peace has fun with his role as Fernand- he is so delightfully sarcastic, arrogant and manipulative. Though he played his vulnerable side so well. Luis Guzman and JB Blanc should also get recognized for making this actual revenge plot of this movie happen- they are involved as mercenaries and friends of the count in almost every revenge scene. They are both funny, interesting and believable in their roles. James Caviezel stole my heart away as Edmond... he really played the transition of the character SO well, both in emotions and in the age of the character. I could hardly recognize Edmond as the Count from Edmond the innocent youth. Also, Dagmara Dominczyk was fantastic, though admittedly, I know little about her. I must say, she was given a sappy part (she cries in most of her scenes) and she handled that demanding role well! She was beautiful and sweet. James Frain is one of my all-time favorite actors, though he is not a megastar. I simply adore his acting. He plays a gray villain in this movie- not quite a total bad guy but certainly has his share of bad deeds. It was fun to see him in this part for sure. At first I was surprised at him being casted for that role, but I just came to love the part.<br /><br />Give this movie a try and just sit back and enjoy. The plot is solid and just complex enough. The acting is superb. It is not a perfect recreation of the original novel but it IS a perfect capture of the IDEA of the novel.

Normally I don\'t care for his  movie choices because he loves Star Trek and action films.  WOW, this is a  GREAT MOVIE. I think the only reason anyone would give it less than ten stars :) is that they do not pay close enough attention in the beginning. SO, without spoilers I will explain the beginning....<br /><br />A man is in love and also has a best friend.  The man gets a promotion at work (basically) and when he does...he proposes.  Soon after, he is approached by Napoleon (no, this is not a boring history film, not at all!) and is asked to carry a letter to someone.<br /><br />The man is caught helping Napoleon and put in a horrible, underground prison.  He makes a friend there (a priest) and spends all of his time plotting revenge.<br /><br />Well, I can tell you, this movie is one where you get to the end and say \"Wow, I wish I could watch that for the first time AGAIN!\"  It\'s great!  But you do need to pay attention in the beginning...BUT DO NOT BE PUT OFF BY THE BEGINNING.<br /><br />Everyone we watched this with was trying to chat during the beginning. (Family from out of town.)  Just pay attention.  Once he is in prison, which is pretty soon, it really loosens up and is a beautiful, fun film.'),(198,39,'B000063W1R','Frozen','One of my FAVORITE Movies with moral lessons to be learned','This story, written by Alexandre Dumas tells a tale that is as classic and contemporary at the same time as it likely was upon its release as a book in Paris in the 1800s. It is also a tale that almost anyone might find something of value in which to identify. There is innocence, intrigue, revenge, honesty, romance, devotion and narcissism among other personality traits, for good or bad, and clarity around some of the same topics and moral questions experienced by the many vivid characters in this drama. When innocent people go to jail as a result of corruption and a love of materialism, who is to fault? As sophisticated as life was in Paris at the time for people of means, it was rife with corruption.<br /><br />The movie is excellently scripted, wonderfully acted, and truth is, I just can\'t watch it enough! Everytime I watch it I get something or see something else in the story that hadn\'t emerged in my mind earlier. Of course, there are several parts of the film that are my favorite-- if you\'d care to know one: look for the Count when he introduces himself to French (Parisian) society with his \"Greetings.\"<br /><br />I recommend this film for people of ALL ages. If you\'d like to experience what life was in France during the time of Napoleon Bonaparte, I also recommend this movie. It indeed provides a good history lesson in addition to the moral lessons to be derived from the experiences Dumas captured so eloquently in this masterpiece!'),(199,39,'B000063W1R','Frozen','Could have been better','This addition of the famous story is mostly to be recommended. The acting is first rate and \'Mercedes\' is a knock out. The movie works very well even though it doesn\'t follow strictly to the book. My only criticism is it\'s scanty treatment of the part of the story where Dantes ( The Count ) rescues his old employer and friend from ruin by setting him up with a new ( replica of his original one ) boat. This is one of the central parts of the story and deserved more screen time than it got.'),(200,39,'B000063W1R','Frozen','Revenge, Justice Or Both?','I really  appreciated this film on the second viewing. Afterwards, I thought, \"Wow, that was really a satisfying, great film to watch.\" Satisfying, of course, to see the typical good guy-gets-revenge tale enacted out but also a film which provided some beautiful scenery and photography all the way through.  Boy, I hope this comes out on Blu-Ray some day.<br /><br />Acting-wise, the most fun to watch was Richard Harris as \"Priest,\" the longtime prisoner who tutors young Jim Caviezel, the man (Edmond Dantes) unjustly imprisoned who exacts his revenge in the last hour of the movie. Harris had some of the best lines in the movie, several very profound statements. Ironic that he would be giving Caviezel - who two years later was playing Jesus in \"The Passion Of The Christ\" - sermons about believing in God! That\'s the acting profession; one film you play an  atheist, the next you are Jesus!<br /><br />For those who might think the first 30-40 minutes of this movie are a bit slow, stay with it as the action picks up once Caviezel escapes from the prison. Shortly afterward, he is aided by the other character I found most fun to watch, played by Luis Gusman, who still sounds like he\'s more at home in the streets of New York but, once again, you suspend belief and just go along for the ride.<br /><br />Strange how our human nature makes revenge so sweet when forgiveness is the right thing to do, but Hollywood has always capitalized on this human failing, making enjoyable films like this. To be fair, it isn\'t just revenge, as this film points out, it\'s \"justice\" we all like to see. In here, the two words are interchanged, depending upon one\'s rationalizations.'),(201,39,'B000063W1R','Frozen','Really Great','This movie is top notch.

Under the astute direction of Kevin Reynolds the pacing is good and you truly get a feel for the events. The costumes, sets, and music are well done and add to the illusion of being there. This is a classic and remarkable Alexandre Dumas story of a common man falsely accused and imprisoned. His escape and revenge will have most people cheering or at least on the edge of their seat. The action seems almost non-stop but even the slower moments have good character development and help clarify the story. A fair amount of time is spent with Harris\'s and Guzmain\'s characters which helps develop them. The amount of treasure he finds is overwhelming. I highly recommend you catch this version. Although I have not read the book, this version inspires me to do so as I have a feeling it follows it more closely. Good quality DVD with great replayability.

James Caviezel and Guy Pearce\'s performes are both well-performed.<br /><br />I could imagine James Caviezel as the Count of Monte Cristo as pictured in Dumas\'s novel. The remainder of the characters also fitted their roles well, especially Danglars, Villefort, and Mondego.<br /><br />It is true that this film version is meant to display acting, especially plot sequence. It therefore does not allow the characters time to develop the way that Dumas\'s book did. However, this film does present most of the major aspects of the book that are most important to remember.<br /><br />The revenge sequence at the end of the film does GREATLY variate from the book. For example, Villefort is arrested, Danglars is also arrested, and Mondego dies in a duel. This is not exactly what a BBC drama afficianado might want to see, but then again, no one has ever accused Buena Vista of attempting to mimic the BBC.<br /><br />Overall, if you want to watch the book on DVD, I would advise you NOT to purchase this DVD. However, if you are willing to watch a film that is relatively entertaining, with good acting and well-designed sets (yet not altogether loyal to Dumas), than this might be the film version for you.<br /><br />Otherwise, the Koch Lorber Films French version of the Count of Monte Cristo (1999), starring Gerard Depardieu might serve your purpose better - especially if you know how to converse well in Francais (French).'),(209,40,'B000063W1R','Frozen','A solid movie but will dissapoint any who have read the book','I originally watched this movie before reading the book, and enjoyed it quite a bit.  Friends of mine who had read the book scoffed at the movie for its simplicity and consistent straying from the book.  I have been reading the book for about a month now (and am only about 2/3 done!) and decided to buy the movie, since the book was so entertaining. I have to say that I now agree with my friends - there is simply no way to adequately tell the story in a 2 or even 3 hour movie.  The shift from Edmond Dantes to the Count of Monte Cristo and his various other personalities (Sinbad the Sailor, the Abbe Busconi, etc.) is such a dramatic one that it would require more of a series-type film to sufficiently portray it.  I\'m thinking of something similar to \"I, Claudius,\" \"the Jewel in the Crown,\" \"Band of Brothers,\" etc. You only have to read a couple hundred pages of the book to understand what I mean - it is almost as if the producer would need to hire two separate actors: one to play Edmond and one to play the Count (or one hell of an actor, no disrespect to Jim Caviezel, who still does a fantastic job).<br /><br />It is not that this movie is a poor one; far from it! The story-line is entertaining, the acting strong, and the writing intelligent.  But this movie is simply not the story of the Count of Monte Cristo.  So many changes have been made, and incredibly significant ones! Entire characters and subplots have been entirely ignored, and those characters or subplots that remain are often entirely changed.  For example, Edmond\'s interaction with the smugglers directly after escaping is an entertaining one, but it is not even in the book!<br /><br />If you haven\'t read the book, I suspect you\'ll find this movie a delight; if you\'ve read it and remember any amount of details, you\'ll be bewildered much of the time.  I haven\'t finished the book, but I\'m told that the ending is also entirely different! But to those who can get past the \"it\'s not as good as the book\" syndrome and understand that a 2-hour movie can never compare to literature, I think all can find this enjoyable.'),(210,40,'B000063W1R','Frozen','count of monte cristo','I recieved this movie will before it was due to come to me.

The Bonapartists, the Republicans, and of course the Star Chamber proceedings absent witnesses and certainly absent justice.<br /><br />Edmund Dantes is imprisoned not for something he did but for something he knows. And the prosecuutor who sentences him conspires with Dantes\' friend to arrange a Hitchcockian \'man on the train\' exchange of murder most foul, Villafort sentencing the unknowing Dantes to life or death in Chateau d\'Iff, a watery prison-grave and Mondego, lusting after Dantes\' bethrothed, Mercedes, to murder his Villafort\'s father, an embarrassing Bonapartist.<br /><br />The movie reeks of post revolutionary Paris and you get a palpable sense of the times. Dangerous times, but times when a man of revenge and money might make his way.<br /><br />We feel for Dantes once he escapes from prison, on the one hand rooting for his victory while on the other, saddened by his consumption of hate.

Cavizel is Edmond Dantes, a young sailor awarded the captain\'s role of a merchant vessel.  His fiance is thrilled but his best friend Mondego (played by Guy Pierce) is jealous.  On their last voyage, the ship had made a stop at Elba where Dantes and Modego talked with Napolean.  Mondego used this meeting and the help of a jealous sailor named Danglars to frame Dantes for treason.<br /><br />Despite th attempted frame, Dantes is about to be let go when the government attorney Villefort has a change of heart.  That night, Dantes is sent to prison not knowing why.  His fiance Mercedes and Mondego plead for Dantes life, but Villefort refuses to release him and even tells them Dantes has been executed.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Dantes languishes in prison questioning God and his will to live.  Soon, Dantes meets a priest who tunnelled into Dantes\' cell mistakenly while trying to escape.  They become best friends and the priest teaches Dantes everything he knows about life, the arts, fighting and even tells him about a hidden treasure.  Soon Dantes escapes from prison.  At his point the movie is half over.  The second half of the movie portrays Dantes transforming himself into the Count of Monte Christo for the soul purpose of getting revenge on those who wronged him.  In my opinion, this is the best part of the movie, yet it is too short to give proper attention to the revenge schemes Dantes uses or to show how is character has changed over the years.<br /><br />This is a beautiful, colorful movie to look at with great acting and adventure.  This is a classic story and I recommend this movie (and the book).  Some downfalls I noticed were Cavizel\'s portrayal of Dantes after he escaped from prison.  Now after reading the book, I think Cavizel\'s portrayal was accurate, but the movie didn\'t last long enough to give it justice.'),(215,41,'B000063W1R','Frozen','Good entertainment!!!','Director Kevin Reynolds keeps you pleasantly entertained with light humor in the classic story of the Count of Monte Cristo. I look forward to seeing this movie again.'),(216,41,'B000063W1R','Frozen','Count on a Great Freakin\' Movie','I must confess that I have not read the book that this movie is based on.  I did enjoy the few Dumas stories I have read, though.  Most people that give this movie a big thumbs down have read the book and, rather unrealistically, expect a perfect translation of a 900+ page book into a film with a run time of just over 2 hours.  Obviously, that\'s not going to happen.  So I\'ll just tackle the film itself.<p>The Count of Monte Cristo hit the theaters in early 2002, arriving with all the fanfare of...well, you know when the grocery store gets a new shipment of cereal?  Less than that.  But sometimes the smallest splashes result in the greatest impacts.  The Count of Monte Cristo came out and reminded the few who saw it that a movie can have a great, cohesive story with superior acting and entertain without being either pretentiously arty or exceptionally lowbrow.  As I said, all of the actors are great:  Jim Caviezel, Guy Pearce, Richard Harris, Tom Everett Scott, Luis Guzman, Michael Wincott, etc.<p>If you\'re looking for an accurate adaptation of the novel, this probably isn\'t your place, but if you\'re looking for an entertaining, epic film with action, intrigue, betrayal, revenge, and even a dash of comedy, you can\'t do much better than The Count.'),(217,41,'B000063W1R','Frozen','Better than the book','This is the first time I have preferred a movie over the book on which it was based, something I thought would never happen. The movie is only loosely based on the Dumas novel. Some reviewers have complained that the movie is not true to the book. It would be impossible to make it true to the book in a two-hour period. There are so many subplots in the book\'s 118 chapters that a movie would have to be several hours long to portray it faithfully. <p>While I loved the book, I actually liked some of the departures from the original storyline. When reading the book I wanted to sympathize with Edmond but found it harder as the story went on. In the book Edmond in the end is a rather unlikable, arrogant character (despite the good he does). In the movie he regains the decency he had before his imprisonment. In the book he abandons Mercedes to a life of loneliness despite her obvious love for him and settles down with a girl young enough to be his daughter. In the movie he reunites with Mercedes. In the book he harms people who were not responsible for what happened to him and doesn\'t care about consequences until a woman and child end up dead as a result of his behavior. In the movie he metes out justice and harms only the people who deserve it. The movie is a great moral tale, a great struggle between good and evil. In the book the line between good guy and bad guy is blurred, and Edmond becomes, in many ways, no better than Fernand, Danglars and Villefort. By removing the moral ambiguity I feel that the screenwriters have actually improved on what Dumas wrote, which is rare for film adaptations.<p>This appears to be a fairly low budget movie, so be prepared for some imperfections, such as the lack of great background music that I would have expected of a period piece. I also agree with some reviewers that Fernand was miscast. Having said that I still highly recommend buying this movie.'),(219,41,'B000063W1R','Frozen','Literature comes to life','There is simply no other word to describe the newest visual version of this great classic but Magnificent!  The Count has always been one of my favorite literary characters and he is brought to life -- a true storybook treatment of the original novel.  The scenery, sets, direction, cinematography and every other aspect of this film are beyond comparison with any other movie my husband and I have seen in the past several years.<br />  The movie sweeps the viewer away from the very first moments, incorporating historical characters and events into a story which develops and broadens as the movie progresses.  On the night I saw this film (my birthday -- my choice), I had received a painful shot to ease torn muscle pain in my arm.  My husband and I really debated whether we wanted to go out at all simply because I wasn\'t in the mood to do anything.  But I had so wanted to see this movie since I first saw the previews that I decided to brave it (we already had a sitter lined up too).  By the time the movie was 15 minutes in, I had forgotten the pain, relaxed back in my seat and was totally enthralled.<br />  We are very picky about the movies we go to see and have not been overly impressed of late with the selections available.  We would usually rather stay home and watch one of our 2000+ VHS tapes or growing collection of DVDs.  This film was so incredible, we went back 11 days later and saw it again (something we never do except occasionally with Star Trek movies).

This priest not only educates Dante, but also gives him a map to a great treasure. When Dantes escapes he finds the treasure and then begins his quest of retaliation against those who betrayed him.

Other times you luck out and get what appears to be cool behind-the-scenes documentaries.  What you get, in fact, are hammy interviews with the cast and crew as they go about their business of making the movie.  And most of the explanations of the more technical aspects are as about as in-depth as you\'d get on Entertainment Tonight.  <p>There are exceptions, of course, such as the first Matrix which offered details about how they created the special effects in the movie.  But it seems these kinds of extras are the exception and not the rule.<p>The Count of Monte Cristo is a pleasant surprise because it truly offers interesting background information that a fan of the movie would want to watch.  <p>A discussion with the screenwriter as to how and why he adapted the script from the original Dumas book was very interesting.  And the short bio on Dumas was a nice surpise.  And unlike other DVDs, this one offers not only deleted scenes, but also commentary about why those scenes were deleted.  Perhaps the only mundane portion of the extras was the &quot;layer-by-layer&quot; audio design segment which took a specific scene of the movie and split the sound into dialogue, sound effects, and music.  But even then, this would be of interest to people who want to learn more about how movies are made.<p>This is a DVD for people who want to know more about the movie and its subject.  I only wish other DVDs were as good as this one.'),(267,42,'B000063W1R','Frozen','Alone, an intriguing film, but short of Dumas\' novel','Reimagining a classic is always a gamble, and this one may come up short if you\'re expecting a full-scale revision of the original.  Dumas\' tale of love, justice, and revenge cannot fit into 2 hours, and this movie attempts to abridge even the most abridged version of the story.  Edmund Dantes (Jim Caviezel) is falsely accused of treason, thanks to jealous and conspiring friends (Guy Pearce and James Frain).  He finds himself imprisoned at Chateau d\'If during his engagement to Mercedes (Dagmara Dominczyk).  Upon his escape from the island, he vows revenge, doing so with unlimited funds from a sunken treasure and under a new guise, the Count of Monte Cristo.  Dantes\' friends, now wealthy and successful, are at first taken by this new count, until he proves to be less of a gentleman than they expected.<p>With all the action and cunning, or because of it, the pacing seemed rather hurried, perhaps because the novel is juicier; for all his 13 years in prison, Dantes exacts his justice rather quickly, leaving little time for emotions on both sides to seethe and boil.  The film focuses unnecessary time on Dantes\' imprisonment, in spite of Richard Harris\' fine performance as a fellow prisoner and a priest who teaches Edmund and later directs him to the treasure; his character is immediately forgotten following Dantes\' escape. In condensing the story, however, the script manages to draw out jealousies born of a lifelong friendship between a commoner, Dantes, and a noble, Fernand Mondego. Jim Caviezel and Guy Pearce fill out their roles exceptionally well.  In less skilled hands, their characters might come dangerously close to self-parody.  Still, the script provides only a faint shadow of Dumas\' rich novel.  <p>The DVD comes stocked with extras, including a biography on Dumas and a study of the novel. There are also deleted scenes, a director commentary, and a segment on the adaptation.  I would have liked some interviews with Caviezel and Pearce, however.<p>If you enjoy the story but not the 200 hours of reading you\'ll need for the book, you should check out the French miniseries filmed a few years back starring Gerard Depardieu.  It\'s much more faithful to the original, and the added time allows Dantes\' revenge plots to precipitate at a delicious pace.'),(268,42,'B000063W1R','Frozen','A True Great Classic','Perhaps one of the best novels ever written, the Count of Monte Cristo is a story of an innocent man that seeks to revenge his wrongful imprisonment.

And Guy Pearce is the greatest.'),(278,43,'B000063W1R','Frozen','One of the best films of 2002!','The Count of Monte Cristo is a lavish adaptation of the 1845 Alexander Dumas novel. The film stars Jim Caviezel as Dantes, a sailor framed for treason by his supposed best friend, Fernand (Guy Pearce). But why would anyone frame his best friend for treason? Well, poverty stricken Dantes has something rich and powerful Fernand does not; love. Fernand wants Mercedes (Dagmara Dominczyk); Dantes true love, for himself. Thus, Fernand concocts an evil setup, framing Dantes for treason. Dantes is then imprisoned on the cruel island prison of Chateau D\'lf for 13 years, where he transforms from a lighthearted sailor to a bitter and angry man. While at Chateau D\'lf, he plots revenge against those who betrayed him.<p>Richard Harris also puts forth a quality performance as Abb&eacute; Faria, another innocent prisoner. With the help of this strange old man, Dantes escapes the island and transforms himself into the wealthy Count of Monte Cristo after following an old treasure map to a load of treasure on the island of Monte Cristo (thus the \"Count of Monte Cristo). Becoming rich and powerful is the first step in Dantes revenge.<p>\"The Count of Monte Cristo\" is such an enjoyable film mainly because of the sweet satisfaction involved in watching Dantes execute his revenge on Fernand. Revenge is always an exciting thing to watch! The audience is able to identify with Dantes and sympathize with him. You may even find yourself becoming as obsessed over exacting revenge as Dantes! My point is; you are really drawn into the story, more so that any film in recent memory.<p>\"The Count of Monte Cristo\" brings in some intriguing aspects of Dantes personality about midway through the film. When Dantes returns as The Count of Monte Cristo, he sees that he could have a perfect life if he wanted to. His love, Mercedes, still wants to be with him and he now has all the money he could ever need. Yet Dantes pushes it all away. He must complete his revenge. It has now become clear that Dantes has become obsessed and can no longer look at the world in a rational way. It\'s really quite painful to see what Dantes has become.<p>\"The Count of Monte Cristo\" boasts an intelligent screenplay, lavish sets and costumes, breathtaking cinematography, superb action sequences, beautiful music, superb directing and stellar acting.'),(279,43,'B000063W1R','Frozen','Should be Locked in Chateau D\'If!','Classics remain beloved for hundreds of years because they are wonderfully crafted and contain universal truths that still speak to us. The director and producer of this condescending adaptation of Dumas\' classic story must feel that the modern American audience doesn\'t have the intelligence to appreciate great classic works.<br /><br />Oh, the basic story line is there--man is wronged, man goes to prison, man escapes, man finds treasure, man seeks revenge. But that is where the homage to this great work ends and the often ridiculous changes are made. I know that it is cliche to say that the movie is not as good as the book. In this case, however, I can\'t believe they actually had the audacity to call the movie by the same name as the classic novel which it so minimally follows.<br /><br />One can excuse some adaptations of a novel when produced as a screenplay, but the changes made in this case lose all the beauty and terrible power of the original story. Instead of a wonderful slow burn with a lot of atmosphere as Dantes slowly and painstakingly weaves a web of revenge for the wrongs done to him, we have stupid devices like a flamboyant entry in a hot air balloon, complete with Cirque du Soleil acrobats twisting on the ropes. Instead of an intricate plan to destroy the personages who wronged him, we have swashbuckling sword fights every few scenes.<br /><br />Some major characters are missing completely (such as Valentine) some have been shamelessly changed and substituted (Jacopo for Ali). The final plot device is totally contrived and NOT in the book--we find out that Dantes has a son sired on Mercedes before he was arrested. I guess the screenwriters felt they had to put some sex in the story or no one would like it.<br /><br />I awaited this production eagerly; having now seen it I feel disgusted and insulted.  If you want to see an intelligent production of the Count of Monte Cristo, avoid this movie like the Black Death. It would be better to lock the DVD in the Chateau D\'If. If you haven\'t read the book, you may enjoy it, since you won\'t be dissapointed by what is lacking. It does have good scenery and filming, although some of the acting is terrible (Jacopo especially).<br /><br />To the director and producers: for shame. Nearly everything about this movie was wrong, wrong, wrong. Give the American audience some credit for pity\'s sake. We can appreciate great works just as they are.'),(280,43,'B000063W1R','Frozen','Well done drama, creative re-interpretation of the book','This movie is excellent as a movie. As far as following the book not so. However let\'s be honest: If this movie were to be faithful to the book, it would be 100 hours long! There are over 200 characters in the book, and several sub-plots that are unable to be adapted to cinema accurately. If one is a purist, don\'t watch movies based on books! You will always be disapointed. The job of someone adapting a book for Cinema, is not necessarily to reproduce the book in exact detail (which in most cases is impossible unless its a tv miniseries that can run all week). It is to reproduce the essence of the story, and find those things which will make for the best film. That\'s tough when you are constrained to 2-3 hours of film.<br /><br />The Count of Monte Christo presents the essence of Dumas\' story, a man betrayed by his best friend, learning the skills to survive in prison from a priest, also unjustly imprisoned, and returns to exact his revenge, and in the process, he learns that revenge is not worth it. The acting, costume, music, cinematagraphy and sword play is second to none, and the movie is quite entertaining.<br /><br />The only problem I had was that they spend a lot of time building up God, and religion and morals, then present fornication and adultery in a positive light because Dantes and Mercedes \"Loved each other\", which as a Christian I had a problem with. Maybe that doesn\'t bother the non-religious viewer, but it presents a contradiction to me that is at best difficult to reconcile and at worst ruins the moral impact of the movie.'),(281,43,'B000063W1R','Frozen','Superb','I was blown away by the incredible adaptation of a familiar tale.  Jim Caveziel was hauntingly sensitive, only to turn fearfully vengeful.  His nemesis, and former best friend, Guy Pearce, hinted at a carefully concealed malice before indulging in a fearsome betrayal.  Everything in this film works. The sword play in this Alexandre Dumas swashbuckler is awesome.  The sets, the costumes, all combine to seduce the viewer.  Furthermore, the DVD extras are excellent, both informative and entertaining.  I can remember Richard Chamberlain\'s Count from the 70\'s, I believe, and I did not expect to ever see a better one.

A definite must-see,which I somehow missed when it was released.'),(282,45,'B000063W1R','Frozen','Changed the whole tone of the thing by changing the end','I agree that it may be necessary to change parts of a story to make the 2 hour limit common to most movies.  I think that the ending (without giving it away, if you care) goes counter to the vengence theme Mr. Dumas was weaving.  So as to who the Count winds up with may be an issue of what is acceptable to the movie industry racially, and it may just be a simpleminded simplification.  If you\'ve never read the book, read it.  It is melodramatic.  The ending in it makes more sense than the end of this movie.<br />As an aside, I think that Mel Gibson must have seen this movie and settled on Mr. Caviezel as the lead after seeing his portrayal of the imprisoned Edmond Dantes.  He is whipped 3 times in the movie and is made up to look astonishingly like the Jesus he portrayed in Gibson\'s movie.  Looks like he is being type cast.'),(283,45,'B000063W1R','Frozen','This Movie ROCKS!','I recently watched this show at the movie theater that gets all the movies later and charges [a cheaper rate] to watch them.

The characters are thumbnail sketches, which lack all the depth necessary to convey the true meaning of this story. There is no sense of revenge, lost love or even enlightenment of revealed secrets. Instead of really feeling sympathy for the wronged Edmund Dantes you may actually feel disdain for his naivete. Richard Harris brings some life and period humor as Dantes\' mentor and prison mate. This portion of the film is very good being well developed and structured. However, when Dantes escapes and returns as the Count it seems like the rest of the film got compressed to fit it into a pre-determined time slot.'),(285,45,'B000NDFLWG','The Conjuring','Borrow now, pay later - an American way of life','Americans spend more money than they make and that\'s the modern trend in today\'s society.  This stems from the fact that it is so convenient to live this way but it is also a progressive danger to consumers and the economy.<br />The public faces a daily barrage of advertisements for credit cards and lending options and it filters down to everyone in all walks of life.  In 2005 alone, the top 10 credit card companies spent over 2 billion dollars in advertising.<br /><br />Commercials have been shown to use subtle and creative messages to tap into your subconscious desire to spend money but no attempts are made to educate individuals about any fiscal responsibilities.  The situation is even worse when you realize that many companies have inflated interest rates, they overcharge on late fees, and some often misappropriate confidential consumer information such as you personal credit history.<br /><br />Looking at the dilemma of this debt crisis begs the question of what is going wrong.  A big element is the fact that rising costs of healthcare, housing, education, and consumer goods hurts so many and credit and lending play a significant part here.  The federal government is another factor that does not favor the consumer and hurts you more than it helps.  Recent bankruptcy reform initiated by President Bush now makes it more difficult for persons to file bankruptcy and recover from financial hardship.  Powerful lobbyists in Washington are very influential in helping to manipulate fiscal policies and financial institutions are the number one contributors to political campaigns.<br /><br />There really isn\'t any happy ending in sight to this widespread problem but there is a growing light at the end of the tunnel.  Consumer advocate groups are becoming more prominent nowadays and their attempts at debt education and awareness are steadily working their way into mainstream society.  Any type of help whatsoever is productive and necessary for everyone affected and this keeps the hope alive that we can eventually make significant progress in overcoming our huge dependency on borrowed money and credit.<br /><br />`In Debt We Trust\' really appealed to me because it was quite comprehensive in how much material it covered and because it was presented in an easy to understand and straightforward manner.  For informational and educational purposes, I would seriously recommend this documentary to everyone.'),(286,45,'B000NDFLWG','The Conjuring','A problem for all of us...','About 2/3 through this film, the director, Danny Schecter, talks about the predatory and devestating effects of the \"subprime\" lending formula. As that has become an issue of late, you might see the film as a prophecy, and a sign the the bubble is, indeed, bursting.<br /><br />I feel compelled to point out that a few 1-star reviewers saw this DVD as an indictment of Bush. Those people either didn\'t see it or had such a pro-Bush bias that they didn\'t hear Schecter and those he interviewed repeatedly saying that it pervades both parties!<br /><br />And another important reflection: the standard line when credit issues come up is something those of us allegedly on \"the left\" ignore, i.e., individual responsibility. Did you really have to buy that flat screen TV? I won\'t deny that, but nor will I deny that the very basis of our whole economic culture is CONSUMPTION. That stuff is shoved down our throats all the time. Indeed, if people would refrain from that sort of consumption, the US economy would fall apart in a week. So there are two sides to that as well. In fact, there is a portion of the film which describes stores in the \"low income neighborhoods of color\" in NYC which have \"rent to own\" shops where people will end up paying $750 for a television they could get for $195 at a mall. What\'s more, it doesn\'t do us much good to ignore individual responsibility, but why not acknowledge the responsibility of those pressing and making the loans--off of which they\'re making obscene profits--too! Or are they responsible for nothing?<br /><br />The film begins with a Baptist congregation in Norfolk, VA where the congregation helps out members who\'ve gone bankrupt. They bail out that person and decry being in debt. The story continues in chapters, based on who\'s going bankrupt (including actress Lorraine Bracco of \"The Sopranos.\" What? A movie star can go broke??) and why.<br /><br />It covers the predatory companies. Ironic, I just saw it ten minutes ago and am still processing the whole concept. I guess I relate to it as I\'ve been saying the same thing for a long time. When I went overseas as a professional 30 years ago, my boss did not qualify for a credit card (so, needless to say, nor did I). I was in my 30s when I got my first credit card. When I moved to the area where I live now and got a job at the national HQ of an association, a colleague of mine joked that his high school son got junk mail for credit cards daily. That\'s how \"easy\" it was/is to get credit. The film too discusses with young people the debt they\'ve incurred because of such cards. (One young woman had spent the last nine years paying off half her $16,000 in credit card bills, and felt it\'d take her as much to pay off the next half. In the meantime, there are credit companies galore giving credit cards to freshman at a Rochester, NY institution).<br /><br />And credit cards aren\'t the only culprits. The film went over tax deals, in which people are given loans at an outrageous rate as an advance on their tax return, the \"rent to own\" shops like I referred to above, again, the subprime loan rates, any number of means that the wealthy will make a lot of money off the shrinking middle class.<br /><br />Again, back to the \"nonpartisanship,\" there\'s a portion of the film in which a conservative radio talk show host sponsors a seminar on cutting up credit cards. So it\'s not a conservative bashing story at all.<br /><br />Toward the end of the film, you might say it ends with a \"metaphor.\" A helicopter with a number of executives of one of the larger credit predators in the US went down in the East River in NY. The executives were rescued, but one of those scholars being interviewed said that, while he wouldn\'t wish such a disaster on anyone, in effect, they may have \"had it coming\" more than anyone else. Then the film returns to the congregation in Norfolk because that\'s the home of a large naval base. And even troops and sailors returning from Iraq are being victimized by the 26 or so shops that give the returning troops instant money so they don\'t have to wait for their paychecks. But that money comes at a BIG price, still another dimension of the credit industry. (Some are taking out one loan to pay off the last, time and time again!)<br /><br />Overall, I think it\'s important that people, young and not so young, see this film. What I wish it had stressed more is that it\'s not just consumption of the frivolous that puts many of us in debt. It\'s also unforseen medical expenses and the type of bills we can\'t avoid that are also driving many of us into the foreclosures and bankruptcies which were the real subject of the film. I mean, that was covered, but needed to have been stressed more.<br /><br />Overall, though, Danny, thanks. We needed to see this.'),(287,45,'B000NDFLWG','The Conjuring','Great DVD for a high school classroom','Every senior in high school and freshmen in college should watch this film!

Fact is, many people can\'t use a reward card or simply don\'t want to deal with greedy credit card co\'s and their long list of dirty tricks and yet they don\'t get a discount when they pay cash because everywhere you go, they take credit cards. And that means merchant fees that we all pay in the form of higher prices!  And these card co\'s have it set up so the merchants can\'t give a lower price for cash customers! It\'s outrageous!<br />And I hope you do more about debt buyers. It\'s insane these co\'s can buy debt for pennies on the dollar and then pile on more interest.  Interest is supposed to be charged for money borrowed!  Nobody borrowed money from a debt buyer and yet they can charge interest!

There should be a law that these co\'s with their dreadful offers not be allowed to send offers to those who have just gotten out of bankruptcy. Unfortunatly, some will not understand these offers or will be desperate. They are nothing but a trap wrapped in envelopes with seductive message like \"we want to help you re establish your credit\" or \"you deserve a second chance\". Those who have filed bankruptcy have gotten a second chance and these predators only want a second chance at ripping them off and putting them in debtors prison again!

It offers some good advice and gives a lot of cause for concern, but leaves you with a feeling of unanswered questions and wanting more information.

In economics, personal credit card debt and the national debt are two very different issues. I find it dishonest that the filmmakers would mislead consumers by lumping both types of debt together - they are separate issues and need to be addressed as such.<br /><br />I would agree with the part of the film where it states \"debt is a much larger symptom of economic and structural issues facing households\" and that \"households are facing declining and stagnating incomes while costs are skyrocketing\". I certainly agree that public policy must be changed to address such issues, however, the film barely touched upon this topic.<br /><br />I kept waiting to hear solutions the film would propose to address personal credit card debt in this nation - whether those solutions be on a personal or national level. In the end, the film gave about a 5-minute soundbite on the how this issue needs to be addressed at the community level.<br /><br />Overall, poorly organized documentary that goes off on tangents. The mention of faith-based solutions at the end without elaborating on what such solutions are rounded off an already weak movie.'),(291,45,'B000NDFLWG','The Conjuring','Slaves to Our Debts','In Debt We Trust warns that the U.S. economy is heading for collapse due to our massive borrowing. Given the current state of the economy (and the role that mortgage debt played in the crisis), the filmmakers appear to have been prescient. I don\'t think that this is a perfect film, but it held my attention.<br /><br />The filmmakers score points when they discuss the marketing of credit cards to young people, especially college students. The film includes stories from many people about the problems their debts have created for them. In one good scene, the filmmakers pawn a car title; the scene is both entertaining and educational.<br /><br />This film travels much of the same ground as another documentary, Maxed Out. Both films include clips from the same film. I like both films, but I prefer Maxed Out because the material seems a bit fresher. I also think that the filmmakers should have included more material about the need for Americans to take some responsibility for managing their debts and becoming financially literate.<br /><br />In Debt We Trust does a great job of starting a conversation - about debt - that is long overdue in the U.S. Given that about 2/3 of our economy is based on consumer spending, I am pessimistic that the government will do anything to discourage debt. Individuals, however, are free to choose a different path for themselves.'),(292,45,'B000NDFLWG','The Conjuring','The usurious state of America','While on vacation several years ago my wife and I got roped into a timeshare presentation.

A house and a car are the only purchases for which one should borrow money.  And I\'m not even sure about borrowing for a car as I pay cash for mine, but then, I buy only used models.<br /><br />The documentary IN DEBT WE TRUST shows just how legal loan-sharking has become in the United States.  Credit card companies and subprime mortgage lenders break Americans who have not already lost their shirts to unemployment and medical bills.  Perhaps no one forces people into the traps of A.P.R.s and A.R.M.s, but this film demonstrates how the creditors hoodwink their victims.  Holding a gun on them would be honest, at least.

Prints of his work just don\'t show the awe inspiring life force that emanates from his paintings.<br />\" Through the Eyes of Van Gogh\" is a sensitive and intense work of art in itself. It achieves an externalization of Van Gogh\'s internal struggles of trying to make a living, trying to relate to others, trying to hold on to his unique vision of art and his brave battle with mental illness, all of which he felt he failed at, at the time of his suicide.<br />I feel this film brilliantly achieves looking through the eyes of Van Gogh, by focusing on his time in the mental hospital with the addition of flashbacks to pivotal points in his life. The writer, who is also the actor who portrays Vincent, has created a portrait of Van Gogh that is as palpable as his paintings.'),(303,47,'B000WI23KA','The Counselor','POIGNANT and PROFOUND','Who is Alexander Barnett?<br /><br />He is the man who wrote, directed and stars in what is arguably the most poignant and profound portrayal of Vincent van Gogh ever put on film. There have been many movie Van Goghs: Kirk Douglas\' rendition in LUST FOR LIFE is magisterial.  But despite the intense veracity of Vincente Minnelli\'s 1956 film, there were warts beneath the warts in the actual history that just didn\'t make it to the screen in that lavish and rich outing.  Robert Altman offered a grimmer and grimier version of things in VINCENT AND THEO and Tim Roth gave us a more insular artist - whereby from all historic accounts the destined Dutchman was extremely demonstrative and vocal and all over the place.  Jacques Dutronc\'s turn with the paint brush in VAN GOGH was likewise introspect in a biopic that flung facts around as wildly as Van Gogh flung paint anywhere and everywhere in his frenzied attack of the nihilistic blankness of the ever-goading canvas.<br /><br />In Alexander Barnett - through his raw,ragged and really realistic THE EYES OF VAN GOGH - we have an actor who seems to be channeling the actual spirit of the artist.  For starters, he looks probably the closest to what Van Gogh probably looked like - given that there are no photographs of him as an adult and all we have to go by are his many variegated self-portraits.  There are many sequences in this film wherein I felt I was actually looking at the real man, as if caught on some time machine of a film camera.  But beyond the outward, it is in the probing of the inward that Mr. Barnett excels.  From start to finish, he never loses Van Gogh in himself.  There is not a false note in the performance.  His acting is a veritable acting class in and of itself.  If he and this film had ever been elibigle, his is a performance supremely worthy of an Oscar.<br /><br />The script is sublime.  In it, Mr. Barnett dares to bravely show us the darkest sides of Van Gogh.  These scenes are painful to watch, if one is totally sold on the Van Gogh-as-Saint interpretation of history.  Yet balanced with that blackness, shown are all of the reasons why  - as Don McClean sings in STARRY NIGHT -<br />\"this world was never meant for one as beautiful\" as Vincent.  If Mr. Barnett\'s script were only available in printed form, it would still be (in addition to being historically accurate and revealing)intense and exciting to read but - in the finished film - these scenes are enacted with such passion and pathos that they seem less acted than lived. As directed by Mr. Barnett, there is a John Cassavettes-like sense of improvisation and therefore total reality that packs one tremendous emotional wallop after another.  And like Cassavettes and even Welles in certain instances, Mr. Barnett holds many scenes for incredible amounts of time that lesser directors would be too timid to even attempt.  These long, unedited sequences carefully build the utter sense of reality that Mr. Barnett was evidently after and has so eminently achieved.  We, as viewers, become part of what we are watching - in ways that are quite rare to most movies.<br /><br />Also in this immense film there are many set-pieces and images that will stay with one for a long, long time.  Haunting sequences and rivetting images that are imaginativey conceived and expertly, flawlessly delivered.  One example is when Vincent imagines/dreams/fantasizes/hallucinates the death of his beloved brother.  After the \"imaginary\" sequence there is a sharp cut to Vincent sitting up in his asylum bed in the middle of the night, crying and cradling what is apparent emptiness - but is, instead, the impossible thought of a lost Theo.  Brilliantly, in this one sequence alone, this one image of Vincent cradling \"emptiness\", volumes are spoken - for in the event of losing Theo, Vincent would indeed be cradling emptiness.  But in the larger context, this one image of Vincent cradling \"emptiness\" in the middle-of-the-night speaks largely and painfully for most of the whole of his life.  It is in such brilliant, often worldless scenes and sequences that Mr. Barnett\'s vision explodes from the film frame as passionately and as profoundly as Vincent van Gogh\'s vision exploded from his canvas frames and bathed the world in color and gave us a new way of seeing. As Van Gogh\'s work transcended the bounds of its frames, so also does Mr. Barnett\'s film transcend the boundaries of the movie or television screen. In both instances, with both artists, Art does what it so rarely does.  Art... becomes Life.'),(304,47,'B000WI23KA','The Counselor','The Eyes of Van Gogh','A remarkably sincere, honest, HUMAN insight into the pain Van Gogh endured.

Barnett takes us into the heart and mind of the man in a way that causes us to empathize afresh with his feelings and struggles. Barnett the film-maker deliberately refrains from any cutting from one camera to another, enhancing the viewer\'s being drawn into the world as viewed from Van Gogh\'s perspective. The score is also effective in painting an aural picture of what is going on inside the artist\'s mind. In this film we see Van Gogh, not just as a troubled soul, but as a sensitive and caring person who never quite found the way to break free of the demons from his past that haunted him up to the end of his life. Barnett\'s portrayal of Van Gogh is both believable and engaging. Despite the film\'s length of almost two hours, it holds the viewer\'s attention and moves the heart.<br />A haunting and emotionally draining experience, but a must see., 6 March 2007<br /><br />Author: jstachelek from United States<br /><br />Having seen some of Barnett\'s earlier work on stage in N.Y., I was more than familiar with the depth and breadth of his ability as an actor and director; how seemingly effortlessly he brings each of his characters to life. I was fully prepared to be equally moved by his interpretation and portrayal of Vincent van Gogh. I knew that Barnett could be electrifying on stage and I was curious to see how his energy would translate on film.<br /><br />Nothing, however, prepared me for the emotional shock I experienced by his haunting rendering of the most tortured months in the life of van Gogh. The intensity that Barnett brought to this role can only be described as \"insane.\" One can but imagine the years of research and total immersion into the life of van Gogh it must have required to be able to portray with such shocking clarity what was in van Gogh\'s heart and mind during this brief period of time. Another commenter describes Barnett\'s performance as, \"as close to insanity as you will ever get.\" I agree.<br /><br />The film is not highly polished in the typical sense. The lighting is poor at times, the sets and scenery drab, and while I know nothing about film editing, I found some of the flashbacks unnecessarily confusing. These perceived flaws could be due to budget constraints, but knowing something of Barnett\'s work, I tend to think there is some intention on his part. The overall effect is that the viewer experiences the bleakness that is Vincent\'s life at the time. At times in the film, what is reality and what is only in van Gogh\'s tortured and clouded mind is as indistinguishable to the viewer as it is to Vincent, making the viewing experience all the more haunting and disquieting. An amazing feat, whether intentional or not.<br />The essence of van Gogh, 27 February 2007<br /><br />Author: paulhodgson-1 from United States<br /><br />The viewer who has not encountered Mr. Barnett\'s work before may at first feel some disorientation, even shock, at the style and emotional intensity of this award-winning movie. The realization may grow, moving into it minute by minute, that what Barnett has done in his own artistic venue is in many ways comparable to what Vincent did in his -- transforming the artist\'s own clear perception of reality and life (in this case, Vincent\'s) into forms strikingly different from any seen in that venue before. This is not the kind of commercialized, mundanely Hollywood-slick film making that we are used to, which I find so often boring, in the end. I\'d say to those who would be disappointed by that: look elsewhere.<br /><br />Having had the pleasure of seeing some of Barnett\'s early work in NY on stage -- Miller and Shakespeare at their best, in my book -- I did not require a period of readjustment of expectation and perception. (At age 33, he did the best King Lear I have ever seen.) What challenged me, in a very positive way, was the complexity and nuance of compressing Vincent\'s life story, spirit, and values into the remarkably short format of a 111-minute run time. Having known Vincent\'s story as of decades ago, but not having read the letters of Vincent and Theo, I found it difficult to approach this work with a pristine eye or ear. Would the naive viewer quite understand the context of this or that event (say, the Borinage time), etc? And would the unavoidable constraints of a low budget production detract from the essential experience and value of the work? Impossible for me to know, and anyway, I\'m no film critic.<br /><br />I can say that I have it on good authority that the script remains true to the van Gogh letters, and the portrayal certainly remains uniquely true to Vincent\'s spirit and work. As film making (his first feature work), it uses the full palette, visually and emotionally. My advice: do not view it casually. That would be a waste.<br /><br />Nota Bene: Roy Thinnes is so very Peyron. (I really enjoyed his role in X Files, too.) All said and done -- 9 stars. It will sadden me if we don\'t see more of Barnett on film, as it does that we don\'t have some earlier work on film.<br /><br />As close to insanity as you\'ll ever want to get, 24 February 2007<br /><br />Author: AlwaysRomantic from United States<br /><br />The legend of Van Gogh haunts the ages.

He wanted to paint the air that we could sense but not see. He wanted to paint emotion. But his insanity stole reality from him. He couldn\'t tell what was real and what was a distortion of real.

I have always been a great fan of Roy Thinnes and was delighted to be able to see him again. There have been a couple of films about van Gogh. This one, I believe, captures him more truly and believably than any other I have seen. His torment is palpable and fully understandable. This film is about what happens when extraordinary people are for whatever reason unable to fully realize all of their potential. And yet, despite all, they must persevere.

Yet no one was more in touch with the blazing pulse of creation than this tormented man, whose transcendent work has touched us all.<br /><br />To be confronted with such a life, and such a film, is not for the faint of heart; like Van Gogh\'s restless and fiery art, Barnett\'s script is uncomproA superb character study, 29 October 2007<br /><br />Author: klear-1 from United States<br /><br />Before I saw this film, I read about the making of the film and what the director was trying to accomplish. I cannot recall another film about a real person that captured so totally what it might have felt like to be that person and to understand what drove him. I recommend this film to anyone interested in film as an incredible medium for character study. Perhaps this can best, if not only, be accomplished by writer/directors like Ingmar Bergman. In this instance, Alexander Barnett as writer/director/actor has also succeeded beautifully in reincarnating Vincent van Gogh as a being compelled to work, to express himself and his thoughts, to live fully - not as a victim, but heroic in his battle to survive.<br /><br />mising -- and his acting powerful<br />Intense and enlightening, 14 June 2007<br /><br />Author: jlasko from United States<br /><br />Some movies are entertaining. Others are an experience. Alexander Barnett\'s Van Gogh biopic definitely falls into the latter category. Far from \"guilty pleasure\" fare, \"The Eyes of Van Gogh\" is a skillful and passionate portrayal of a talented yet tortured artist. This movie will educate you about the world of this struggling genius, even as it compels you to feel compassion for Van Gogh in his sad state. Competition, debt, insanity, rejection--all of these themes swirl Vincent\'s reality much like the colors in his paintings...you\'ll be relieved to view reality for yourself again at the end. But if you let it, the movie may remind you of all you have to be grateful for, and even challenge you to look at your own life through slightly different eyes.'),(306,47,'B000WI23KA','The Counselor','Dull and unineresting','I took a chance on this low cost download, hoping the low-budget art-house movie would interest my mind and entertain me.<br /><br />First, the digital quality forced me to either sit far back or to shrink the image on my screen.

BUT, it is a fun movie. It is a silly horror/comedy type B movie that became the meat and potatoes of so many early studios. I love it. Jack Haley is Albert Tuttle a nose to the grindstone insurance man who has an appointment with an old rich recluse. He arrives at his mansion and is seen in by the butler (Bela Lugosi). He is shown into his clients office and immediately starts his spiel to the back of a chair and smoke coming from a lit cigar. However, unbeknownst to Tuttle the client is dead and in his coffin in the office. Tuttle lays his brief case on the closed coffin before he realizes just what is in the room. When he does try to get out, he can\'t open the door, etc. This movie is filled with every conceivable cliche imaginable. But that\'s the fun of it. A huge dark creepy house, a will to be read, a suspicious looking butler and cook, a beautiful damsel in distress, a dim witted detective, a houseful of greedy family members of the deceased, murders, trick doors, screams and noises at night, etc. Of course, a very nervous and reluctant hero. This kind of movie would be nothing without Lyle Talbot and he is here as the family member who thinks timid Jack Haley has something to hide.I have had this movie for years and every once in a while I dust it off to watch it again because sometimes you need a little harmless fun.

And while I find it hard to believe that there is anyone who legitimately can hate these kind of movies, there are admittedly some that work far better than others. One Body Too Many finds middle ground.<p>It begins with some cleverness in setting up the scenario. The will\'s gimmick is farfetched but assured an offbeat night of criminal mayhem: The deceased, an astrologer, wishes to be buried above ground so that the stars shine down on him. If anything happens so that he is not, then the heir who was supposed to get the most will instead get the least, and vice versa. The body disappears, then reappears, then someone else is murdered... it\'s all expectedly, even appropriately, convoluted.<p>Our hero is a life insurance salesman who is mistaken for the detective assigned to guard the body from shenanigans. And there is real inventiveness in placing a life insurance salesman in this situation, where people are sure to be bumped off. Unfortunately, this knowing wink to the audience is barely explored at all. The hero himself is an average-looking guy, more likable and less wimpy than many 40\'s B heroes. And he is surrounded by a capable, if unspectacular, cast.<p>Lugosi is wasted, although his stock Ominous Butler character is interestingly played for laughs this go-round, ready and willing to bump off anybody who anyone else thinks needs bumping off. Watch out for the coffee.<br /><br />This is of course, a comedy/mystery, as every picture in this genre has been since The Cat and the Canary in the 20\'s. And the comedy is generally the determining factor in how watchable these kind of films are. Here it is not too bad, consisting less of the typical scared mugging and awkward pratfalls than many similar efforts. Only in its dull, protracted middle section does the film lose its way, as the hero gets lost in the ubiquitous secret passageways, caught in a wicker basket with a litter of kittens and wearing only a towel. Don\'t ask.<p>There are a number of good scenes, including one where the hero, hiding in a coffin, is carried off and dumped in a pool. The movie ends with a suspenseful chase and confrontation atop the observatory. But there is not enough made of the good ideas in the script, and too much damage is done to the whole by the weak or old ideas in the script. You\'ve seen much of it before, so it\'s not quite worth a purchase. Close but no cigar.<p>See also: The Cat and the Canary; Black Cat (1941); Night Monster; Old Dark House; The Monster Walks; The Gorilla; Seven Keys To Baldpate; The Bat Whispers; and many, many more, if you are so inclined.'),(426,47,'B008FPU7AA','The Counselor','Lugosi Steals the Show','One Body Too Many (1944) is a routine Jack Haley mystery-comedy with decent production values and an agreeable supporting cast.

Anyway, insurance salesman Albert Tuttle (Jack Haley, whose career included the Shirley Temple movies \"Poor Little Rich Girl\" and \"Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm,\" and the role of the Tin Man in \"The Wizard of Oz\"), arrives at the home of Mr. Cyrus Wentworth, where he is supposed to be selling Mr. Wentworth an insurance policy.  Unfortunately, Mr. Wentworth has already passed away.<br /><br />Mr. Wentworth has specified that certain conditions must be met before his heirs get the goodies.  On the other hand, if the conditions are not met, the terms of his will are to be reversed.  Soon people are dying and disappearing, and Albert Tuttle ends up in a coffin in the pond.  It is mostly in good fun with periodic humor thrown in.  Bela Lugosi lurks about as butler Murkil.  Since I knew of Bela Lugosi\'s history in horror I kept thinking that Lugosi was the bad guy in this movie.  You will have to watch and see about that.<br /><br />This movie has all the attributes of an Old Dark House type of movie.  There are sinister locations and characters, and murders that seem to have been impossible.  We do not find out who is doing all the deeds until the end of the movie, which is full of action.  This movie is neither the best in this genre nor the worst.  This movie did have some fun moments and I found myself glued to the television while waiting for events to unfold.

If Cyrus\'s body is not interned by his wishes then the heirs will swap places, i.e. those that get the most will now get the least. No one knows who is going to get what, they can only guess...or does someone know? Bela plays the butler who tries to give everyone \"poisoned\" coffee late in the evening, which they all refuse.

The guests mistake him for the detective they hired to guard the body.<br /><br />Of course Bela is not the only seemingly trying to knock off heirs...Then there are those who suspect they are the least of the heirs. They want to steal and hide the body so they can get a greater share. Sweet Carol Dunlap (Jean Parker) is suspected of getting the largest share. Lyle Talbot, who starred in so many Ed Wood films is in this one as well as Dorothy Granger from \"Death Valley Days.\"<br /><br />The sound track at times indicates this is a \"horror\" film while at other times a comedy. It is far from a horror movie. At one point when someone is killed, the suspects are all gathered into one room, as a real who-dun-it murder mystery, except with the comedy of Jack Haley leading the spoof.<br /><br />This is an excellent film which has stood the test of time.

Like many B outfits they had a stock company of directors (Frank McDonald, William Berke) and players (Richard Arlen, Chester Morris, Roger Pryor and others).<br /><br />Late in the war, Pine-Thomas signed Jack Haley to star in musical-comedies, but the first one, TAKE IT BIG (with Ozzie and Harriet) was a disappointment, so they cast Haley in a mystery-comedy called ONE BODY TOO MANY.<br /><br />Cyrus Wentworth, a crazy multi-millionaire, has died, leaving a will that insults his heirs and promises that half of them will get a lot of money and the other half will get piddle, unless the exact terms of his will aren\'t carried out, in which case the piddlers will become the piddlees and vice versa.

This viewing was years  before video became available so all I could look for was a sountrack album  to the terrific Garcia score.  Nope, it didn\'t exist.  Then along came  video.

It features Rod recreating the  role of the Time Traveller (so I believe), some dialogue and behind the  scenes stuff.

The movie itself set the tone for science fiction movies too with it\'s original setting and the ability to show the passage of time through several devices such as the circulating sun and the tailors dummy.<p>It is the conception of the novel however, which for me emphasises the differences between this movie and the newer version. The central difference lies in the somewhat ordinariness of the society of the Eloi. They are living a simple, almost idyllic lifestyle, knowing nothing much about the world around them except what they need to know. They live in ruins with food and clothing provided for them. In the newer version there is some complex structures which do not make a whole lot of sense as they are still susceptible to raids from the Morlocks.<p>The Eloi suggest a socialist society where each according to ability each according to need whereas the Morlocks represent the evils of the capitalist machine.

But special effects does not a classic make, unless that\'s all you look for in a movie. I have no doubt that the 2002 release of \'The Time Machine\' will trounce the original in this department, but everything else being equal, I doubt it will become a classic, as this movie has.<p>Having said that I must say the original \'Time Machine\' is perhaps one of my favorite Sci-Fi movies of all time. What makes this movie special is the great attention to plot and characterization, as well as keeping scrupulously to the H.G. Wells novel, both in content and in characterization. By contrast I\'ve heard that the remake was quite revisionary. <p>Rod Taylor does a splendid job in portraying the inventor with a consciense, the man who must wrestle with questions that have no easy answers. The viewer can sympathize with his predicament of using his invention for the betterment - or detriment - of mankind, no easy task since he is surrounded by friends who can only think in terms of the material. <p>At the core of this movie is his friendship with David, played splendidly by Alan Young (Mr. Ed). One of the most noticeable things about this film is the commaraderie between these two men, as well as their differences: George, the idealist, and David, the pragmatic. Yet in SPITE of the differences, their friendship endures. This is especially seen in \'Time Machine: The Journey Back\' a sequel (or followup) to the original movie and which is featured on the DVD. <p>The music score by Russell Garcia is another factor that makes this movie so special. It fits perfectly into each scene so seamlessly that you can\'t imagine another music score for this film.<p>In closing, the remake my be more exciting to watch, but I doubt if it will be as thought-provoking as the original, which in my opinion is the one, only, and future \'Time Machine\'.'),(445,49,'790747324','The Croods','A Classic with some cool extras','Simply one of the most entertaining films of all time.

A siren starts to wail and the Eloi start marching like mesmerized lemmings to a cliff...into the underground.  For...here\'s the kicker...the Eloi are the Morlock\'s food supply.  Can you say cannibalism?  I knew you could.  Overall, this 1960 classic can\'t be denied its rightful place in film history.  Looking back the effects pale in the light of CGI, but they were more pure back then, more real, and people like George Pal paved the way for the things possible today.  This is a great movie!

I saw it on TV and -due to the TV set-in B & W not it color. However it had a great impact on me because of the incredible and magical special effects. For a small boy years away from the computers enviroment this was the very best movie of all...and it still is.<br /><br />I wonder why George Pal never become such a great entrepreneur as Walt Disney. Obviously the both had a special gift and used it to bring their imagination close to the public mainly through motion pictures.<br /><br />And in speaking of pictures, Pal and Disney established their own landmarks, from my point of view, with \"The Time Machine\" and \"20,000 Leagues under the Sea\" respectively.<br /><br />\"The Time Machine\" may seem outdated compare to the astonishing CGI movies of nowadays but it has something that will keep it on the SCI FI top ranking: it makes you believe for a moment it\'s possible to travel through time.'),(452,50,'790747324','The Croods','Once Upon a Wondrous Time...','Every viewing of The Time Machine takes me back to the wonders of childhood: bubblegum trading cards, comic books, and George Pal movies. The early sixties was a great time to be a kid. With other classics like Journey to the Center of the Earth to entertain our eager young minds, our eyes frequently popped at the terrific adventures we witnessed onscreen. The Time Machine endures as great cinematic storytelling.<br /><br />When I was little, the movie scared me. Remember, the atomic attack comes in 1966, which was still the future for us then. My favorite part has always been when George fast-forwards in his lab. However, that gave me some anxiety at the time because it disturbed me that he was leaving home and maybe never coming back. I thought the Morlocks were great monsters and seem to recall my friends and I dividing up between Morlocks and Eloi for some play fighting later. Of course it was more fun to be a Morlock than an Eloi. But if you got to be Rod Taylor, then you had ARRIVED.<br /><br />One of the interesting things I noted on my last viewing was the technology. 80.000 years into the future, what remains of knowledge is stored on old \"rings\" that spin to speak. I turned and looked at my ten-year-old son and said, \"That could be cds!\"<br /><br />Round, shiny discs that play an audio recording when spinning-sounds just like a cd to me. Even in 1960, this was amazingly prophetic. Also, I mentioned how great it would be to have a replica of the time machine. Then, \"our host\", Robert Osbourne remarked as to how the prop had become lost and then years later bought at a THRIFT STORE! Just imagine that lucky son-of-a-gun.<br /><br />It\'s a shame that we\'ve grown to a time when special effects take precedent over character and story. Fortunately, an occassional film comes forward with both (like LOTR) but the newer Time Machine is not one of these. Rod Taylor and George Pal\'s version is the one to see. Made in the midst of the Cold War, it\'s a question of where are we going as a species: annihilation or ascension. Ultimately, it is an optimistic piece about the noble possibilities that endure despite neverending conflicts inherent in the human experience.

Then eventually you see George but he\'s been beaten up because he has gone on a long journey. Then he talks about the story.<p>  In the next part, George is showing his friends the tiny model of his time machine and he want\'s to proove that time travel really exists. But, when his friends don\'t believe him he decides to go on the long journey.<p>  Then you see George going through many different time periods into he finally gets to the year 802701. Instead of having a lot of technology it\'s just an area of grass. There are a group of people there named the Eloi and they obey a group of monsters called morlocks. The morlocks give the Eloi their food, clothing and in the end they take them underground and kill them. So then George meets one of the girls named Weena when she is just about to drown but luckily George saves her. But, soon George gets mad when he finds out that the Eloi don\'t work very much and they mostly just play, so he goes back to his machine. But, thats when the trouble begins. The morlocks have stolen his machine! They grabbed it and put it in their secret place. So, the only thing left to do is go to the underground area, kill the morlocks, save the eloi and get his machine back and that mostly takes you to the end where George gets his machine back and luckily travels back to his own time.<p>  When George finishes telling them the story they think it is silly but when George shows David the flower that Weena gave to him he starts to change his opinion.<p>  In the end George takes a few books with him and travels back to 802701 to see the eloi again.<p>  The special features include: Behind the scenes documentary time machine: the journey back, hosted by Rod Taylor and featuring Alan Young, Whit Bissel and others involved in the film soundtrack remastered in dolby digital 5.1.

The controls are simple.

Today\'s digital age can make flowers bloom and snails race across the floor more realistically, but the scenes of the sun flying across the sky, for example, were great. And the real beauty of the movie was the story and the message behind it.<br /><br />It\'s hard to judge anything that might happen 800,000 years into the future. Progressive authors have made some interesting predictions in the past (look at the awesome flat-screen TVs in <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000087F6L\">Fahrenheit 451</a>!). This story - and nothing we currently know, I imagine, will still be remembered in 800,000 years. H.G. Wells\'s predictions will not be judged. But in the meantime, it was still an incredibly fun story.<br /><br />The only thing I found disturbing was that the Eloi came across so heartless.

Of the five or six films produced by George Pal, \"The Time Machine\", which was also directed by him, along with \"The War of the Worlds\" (1953) are probably his finest films.  Both films are loosely based on the novels of H.G. Wells and, for their time, boasted state of the art special effects, for which both films won an Oscar.<br /><br />Rod Taylor is the lead character, supposedly H.G. Wells himself, who claims to his friends to have invented a time machine, allowing him to travel back and forth in time.  His brief discussion with his friends, attempting to explain the principles of time travel, similar to the Wells novel, makes it seem almost plausible until one thinks about it a little longer.  Taylor,  whose British accent slowly fades away as the picture goes on, plays his character earnestly and is surrounded by an able cast:  Sebastian Cabot, Tom Helmore, Whit Bissell, Yvette Mimieux, Doris LLoyd, very likable as his house maid, and, in particular, Alan Young, who delivers a perfect Scottish accent, as his devoted but practical-minded Scottish friend.  Why not? Alan Young grew up in Edinburgh.<br /><br />The special effects for this film are basically simple but effective, using time-lapse photography to simulate the acceleration of events that one would supposedly witness if he were rapidly moving forward in time.  His journey, after a few brief stops to observe the two World Wars and a nuclear attack pointedly set in the mid 1960s, ultimately takes him several hundred thousand years into the future in which he encounters a race of \"beautiful people\", the Eloi and a race of barbarous beings called the Morlocks who are (literally) living off the Eloi.  At this point the screen play of the picture and the novel of H.G. Wells part company, the movie pretty much resorting to melodramatic action for its resolution.<br /><br />The video quality of the DVD is very good and the sound recording, as a pleasant surprise, is in genuine and high quality stereophonic sound although it was never presented that way in any theater in which I saw this film.  The music is a rich orchestral score by Russ Garcia and adds a good deal to the effectiveness of the film.<br /><br />I thinks it\'s safe to say that this film version of the Wells novel, with all of its shortcomings, still betters the 2002 remake in spite of the technical superiority of the newer film.

Today the emotional punch of a man saying goodbye to his world, even for what he thought was a brief trip, holds a lot more poignancy now then it did back then. That\'s especially the case for the one friend who holds out on the hope of your return despite the unlikliness of such an event.

He starts with curiosity and ends with a motive.<br />The FX of this film are dated. They have to be. But the story itself is timeless.

His journey leads him to meet with children of his friends from the past, multiple world wars and a future society where humanity has speciated into two opposing groups. Can George prove it all happened and can his machine change fate? If you like any sort of corny classic film then The Time Machine is a whole bag of that and then some more.

The movie tells the story of an inventor named Herbert George Wells (George to his friends) who invents a time machine. George is unhappy in his own time and wants to travels to the future. The film starts in the present and George four friends are at his house waiting for him to arrive. George has left instructions to start dinner without him if he is not there at 8 pm. Just at the four guests are about to dine, George enters the room dirty and clothes torn. George begins the story five days ago when he shows them a prototype of a miniature time machine. When the four friends leave the house, George heads toward his lab and climb into the large scale model and heads into the feature. At first he starts off slowly the he begins to go faster and faster until he reaches October 12, 802,701. George lands in an almost paradise world. The only downside is that there are two different classes of people. The first class live on the land and are called the Eloi and they live simple life of no laws, government and civilization. They know nothing of their past and seems to be void of thought as well. The Elois speak in a childlike way. The second group of people is the Morlocks who live underground, operates the machinery, blue-skinned, and cannot stand the light. The Elois are basically cattle for the Morlocks. The Morlocks clothe, feed, and raise the Elois just to eat them when they are adults. George is appalled by all of this and tries to put this to an end. When George goes down a shaft to rescue Weena and the rest of the Elois and is able to blow up the shafts that the Morlocks can escape from. George eventually arrives five days later when he originally left from. His four friends do not believe his story, but David Filby seems to believe some of it. The Time Machine won an Academy Award for Best Effects, Special Effects (1961).

I still have drawings I did in grade school of glass-domed futuristic houses with large double entrance doors.  The time machine itself, is so humorous, but it is what they would have had in the 1800s for such a contraption.  I was entranced by the Eloi and their lack of emotion and having to do nothing but eat fruit all day.  My infantile mind thought that would be a GOOD life.  I consider this a much better movie than its \"twin\" Journey to the Center of the Earth, but they were both great and thought-provoking, especially to pre-teenagers. The scenes and special effects are phenomenal.  It is because of this movie that I probably eventually decided to write a time-travel novel of my own.

When the Time Traveler gets to 1964 and the air raid sirens are going off, that was it for me. The movie was turned off! I didn\'t see it in its entirety until several years later and I outgrew (mostly) that fear.  I even got a copy of the book and read (most all of) it, for it, too, is a chilling tale of \"what if.\"  I happened to watch the 2002 remake last night and it was OK, and entertaining. It definitely has flashier special effects. (How is it that Guy Pearce can outrun those CGI speed-induced Morlocks?)  Still, this one with Rod Taylor and Yvette Mimieux is the granddaddy.

I think it was a great story, and a great cast and the roles were played out perfectly. Like i said, different yet from all the versions i\'ve seen, this is the one closer to the book of the time traveler disapointed with the present who thought that the future was his answer and that humanity would progress only to be disapointed again when he sees how lazy and dumb society becomes.

The excitement of Victorian discovery is well conveyed, and Rod Taylor, the Australian he-man star, does an excellent job of seeming as though he can think as well as heave his muscles around.  His first moments inside the machine are thrilling, as light changes into dark with a rapidity that astounds him, then light again, then dark, then whole months pass within instants, and then whole years.  When he gets to the future he finds that human beings have somehow bifurcated into two distinct races, the Morlocks a race of strong men who are stupid, the other brainiac weaklings.  Obviously there was a Cold War undercurrent in this George Pal production, and even when we were kids we read the thuggish Morlocks as Stalinist supermen, while the Eloi were us, castrated professors educated out of our balls.  Rod Taylor\'s mission is to re-insert some backbone into those pale pacifist Eloi and get them to fight back against the creatures of the night.  Yvette Mimieux is Weena, exquisitely elfin and needy, in her leaf-colored linen dress, falling for George (HG Wells, Rod Taylor\'s character) despite her natural antipathy towards dark men.<br /><br />This is one of the scariest movies ever made and yet, oddly enough, it is perfect for young children.  Maybe we all like to be frightened from time to time.  Funnily enough I hardly noticed the satirical messages in this movie when I was a little boy, all I knew was that I was scared of the Morlocks, pitied the Eloi, and identified with Rod Taylor and I wanted to be the one who would come sort out the mess of the whole world.  Towards the end of the film George is faced with a big dilemma-should he go back to the Victorian world or should he return to the world 1,000,000 years from now where Weena waits for him?<br /><br />It\'s a treat on DVD, as are the special features and commentary, but Alan Young doesn\'t seem to have a bit of shame in him; he should have apologized to the entire world for the dreadful Scottish accent he uses in the movie.'),(505,7,'790747324','The Croods','Fantasy Classic Forever','George Pal\'s classic movie is a delight from begining to end, and, surprisingly, much closer to Well\'s book than his great grandson\'s lame remake, with much creepier Morlocks.

I wasn\'t expecting it to look as great as it did because the editorial review here gives it 3 out of 5 stars on both the picture and the sound. If you are a big fan of this film, or thinking of buying it as a gift for someone who is, you will not be disappointed with this transfer. The picture is presented in the original widescreen format,so you won\'t miss a bit of the action. To watch it you would think you went back in the time machine to 1960 and were viewing it for the first time. It is clear and sharp with vibrant color.The soundtrack is remastered in Dolby Dig 5.1 and is a welcome enhancement.The DVD also includes a terrific Behind The Scenes documentary called &quot;Time Machine...The Journey Back&quot;. The film\'s star Rod Taylor hosts and fans will love this informative feature. You\'ll get a good look at how the actual machine was made and the journey that it has taken in the last 40 years as well as other interesting tid bits. This feature has it\'s own scene selections to choose from or you can just watch it straight through. The film may be viewed in French and has subtitles in English and French.(my only teeny complaint would be that the black bar area is not used for these subtitles, they are at the bottom of the film).<p>The story based on the novel by H.G. Wells is as captivating today as it ever was. You know the tale.....<br />George(Rod Taylor)has all the time in the world. He tells his friends an incredible story of his adventures traveling through the ages in a time machine that he has built. As his story begins, he starts out slowly traveling through the 20th century. He doesn\'t like what he sees. War and destruction seem to be the fate of civilaztion.He pushes foward, quickly, and the years fly by. Finally stopping in the year 802701,he comes across what seems to be a paradise on earth. Clean air,fruit growing in abundance, and a society of young beautiful people, the Eloi, who don\'t seem to have a care in the world. But even in this Utopian like civilazation there\'s trouble amiss.The Morlocks are running things from underground and they are just as scary today as they ever were.So it\'s up to our guy George to save this future civilazation from the evil Morlocks,and try to get back home to the year 1900 for an 8pm dinner appointment..whew,what a great story!<p>Directed brillantly by George Pal(&quot;7 Faces of Dr. Lao&quot;/&quot;Atlantis the Lost Continent&quot;), the film also boasts the great talents of Alan Young, Sebastian Cabot, and the lovely Yvette Mimieux, as &quot;Weena&quot;, who adds a little romantic interest to the story. The film was awarded a well deserved Oscar for it\'s special effects(also discussed in the featurette) for Gene Warren and Tim Barr.The movie is rated G, although the scenes with the Morlocks might be a little scary for very young children.<p>A great story, fabulous film and an outstanding DVD.

I\'m not so much speaking of the special effects (which were, and still are amazing), but more so the concepts presented within the film, with regards to traveling in the fourth dimension i.e. moving back and forth through time all while occupying the same space throughout...I know, I know, the ideas had been around for some time as author H.G. Wells had created the work the film was based on way back around the turn of the 20th century, but surely the film reached a large audience, quite a few probably never having read his novel.  Produced and directed by George Pal (When Worlds Collide, The War of the Worlds), a pioneer in fantasy and sci-fi cinema, the film stars Rod Taylor (World Without End, The Birds), in what is probably his best-known role as George, a scientist with a hankering to break on through to the other side.  Also appearing is Alan Young, whom many may recognize as the voice for Disney\'s Scrooge McDuck (he also was the only actor from the original film to appear in the recent 2002 remake starring Guy Pearce), Yvette Mimieux (Where the Boys Are, The Black Hole), Tom Helmore (Vertigo), Whit Bissell (Airport, Soylent Green), and Sebastian Cabot (Kismet), whom many may remember as the rotund Mr. French from the late 60\'s television show `Family Affair\'.<br /><br />The story begins in Victorian England with the arrival of a group of distinguished looking gentlemen to the home of their colleague George, played Rod Taylor.  Thing is, George invited them for dinner, but has yet to appear himself, that is until he busts through the door, disheveled and unkempt, with what may be the most fantastic tale any one has ever heard, which takes us back five days prior as George, who\'s an inventor by the way, is having the same group over to reveal his latest invention, a machine that would allow for one to travel backwards and forwards through time.  It\'s all theoretical as the device has yet to be tested, and George is met with skepticism by all except for one, his friend Filby (Young).  Anyway, after the guests leave, George decides it\'s time to put his machine to the test, and what do you know?  It Works!  One should know the impetus for George\'s desire to travel forward in time is based on his dissatisfaction with the current state of human development, specifically out penchant for fighting with each other, and he desires to see a world without conflict, among other things.  As he goes forward he stops a few times but that which he wishes to avoid continually presents itself, eventually driving him into the year 800,000 where the world has become an Eden-like paradise populated by people called the Eloi.  There is no need to work, no laws, no gooberment, just a carefree lifestyle...with a hideous underbelly in the form of a group called the Morlocks, grotesque underground dwellers who are, well, what they are and share a chilling relationship with the Eloi...<br /><br />I found this film to be great fun, and one of the best science fictions films I\'ve seen in a long time.  As far as its faithfulness to the source material, I couldn\'t really tell you, but I did get the feel that there was a lot of respect involved towards Wells\' vision, especially given the film focused a great deal on the moral aspects and implications of who we are and how they may affect future generations.  This, along with superior special effects (which earned the film an Academy Award for 1960) really helped sell the film overall.  Some of the effects may seem quaint by today\'s standards, but back in the day this had to have been cutting edge stuff.  The passage of time indicated by all the meticulous stop motion work, among other things, looks amazing.  I also really liked the whole `Victorian\' feel of the time machine itself, a sense that it was truly created within the time period specified.  I thought Taylor did very well presenting a man driven by his desire to find the best in humanity, only to discover the more things change, the more they tend to stay the same.  It felt like there was real growth from within the character, growth that stemmed from experiencing so much in so little time.  I especially liked the character of Alan Young as Filby as to me he represented sort of the general populous of society, those who live their lives day to day, living within their world, content to make things better through small steps than great strides.  I can\'t remember the specific dialog, but there was a scene that illustrated this well in where Filby tries to convince George to destroy his machine and makes a remark with regards to how we have to live within our time and make the best of it that we can...<br /><br />Warner Brothers provides an excellent wide screen (1.66:1) transfer on this DVD.  The colors are sharp and vibrant, and the picture quality nearly flawless.  The audio, available in both English (Dolby Digital 5.1), French (Dolby Digital 2.0), comes through clean and clear.  There are some special features, including a theatrical trailer and cast and crew bios.  Also included is a 47 minute documentary that looks like it was made for television broadcast as there\'s obvious stopping points for the inclusion of commercials.  The piece, titled The Time Machine: The Journey Back, is hosted by the star of the original film Rod Taylor (looking much older), and offers a lot of details about the film, but the main focus seems to be on the machine itself, how it was developed, created, and its long and curious history after production on the original film ceased.  This takes up most of the 47 minute running time, with what is left used to create a sort of reunion tale as some of the original actors resume their character roles for a short bit.  I found this extra to be really interesting, and it helped me to appreciate the film even more, but I did feel it got a little schmaltzy (even creepy) at times, especially when Taylor would look up in the air and speak like he was talking to producer and director George Pal, who passed away in 1980, and I think this featurette was shot in 1993.<br /><br />Cookieman108<br /><br />Oh, in case you\'re interested, there is no formal seating in the future, only throw pillows, so if you ever get a chance to travel forward in time, BYOC (bring your own chair)...'),(509,2,'790747324','The Croods','The Time Machine DVD Delivers','Like most people, I had only seen this classic science fiction movie on television.  That never detracted from the story, which is one of the best that Wells wrote, but it didn\'t prepare me for how great this movie looks and sounds.  The DVD provides brilliant color and a generally sharp picture with only a little, infrequent  softness that I suspect is from the original film.  I was surprised at how clean the transfer is.  I did not see any scratches, dust or other defects.  The movie is presented in its original, widescreen aspect ratio.  The sound is also excellent.  It has been remastered in Dolby Digital 5.1 and it is an excellent job for a movie that is forty years old.  As you would expect from such an old sound track, most of the action is in the center and front channels, but it uses the rear channels (especially noticable in key scenes, as when Rod Taylor is making echoes in the ruined dome building) and the subwoofer kicked in a few times, also.  The disc provides more extras than you would expect from a Warner release of an old movie.  It includes a trailer, filmographies for the three lead actors and George Pal, and a very good behind-the-scenes documentary.  The documentary was produced by Bob Burns 32 years after the making of the movie and focuses on the important part the time machine prop played in the making of the movie and it\'s history since, with an interesting account of how Burns found and then restored the original prop.  The documentary also features a scene in which Rod Taylor and Alan Young recreate their characters from the movie, acting out a scene that might have appeared in the movie but did not.  The scene uses the restored time machine prop to good effect and it was rather touching to see these much older actors slip so comfortably into their roles.  You could tell that this movie had been one of the high points of their careers and they remembered it fondly.  Likewise, Whit Bissel recreates his character in a short monologue full of a sense of nostalgia.  This old documentary was much more informative and interesting than a lot of the publicity puff pieces included on more recent films as extras. I highly recommend this DVD.

It has a great ending and though the special effects are VERY dated, it\'s still really cool to see the time-lapse effect as he travels through the centuries. The movie is squeaky clean, has little kissing, mild action and is ok for most kids. It\'s a little scary in some parts but the monsters look so cheesy it\'s sort of funny.

I won\'t even bother to tell of the useless struggles of a hopeless future!\'','Though the film has flaws, mostly on the corney side, I think it is safe to say that this is the best adaptation of one of H.G. Wells\' novels to film yet produced.<br /><br />Wells imaginatively projected the \"class struggle\" pondered by Marx (of the capitalist owners vs. workers without a share in the means of production) 800,000 years into the future.  In this way, combining with Darwinian evolution, it becomes a struggle between two sub-species: the underground machine-lord cannibal \"Morlocks\" vs. the above ground, sunshine-loving \"Eloi,\" who the Morlocks simply breed as cattle.  In Wells\' fancy, the differences between classes will become so extreme (assuming the absence of an earlier, political solution), there will eventually be an ironic ambiguity as to which class is really which.<br /><br />To its merit, this is evident enough in the film; but the film adds to that a couple of dated (innaccurate) predictions concerning the \"near\" future (now past).  The result is a risky and somewhat corney ride.  Yet this addition is also fairly well off-set by the fact that the time traveller is allowed to start his journey from the late 19th century (and so from Wells\' own time, as in the novel). The film here has a vivid, added dimesion of the curiosity of a time machine starting its career before high tech--evidently by the sheer genius of a lone inventor. (This device was used by subsequent time travel films--as well as by other Wells-to-film attempts, like The First Men in the Moon, but never as effectively.) In the end, the film successfully portrays a maverick and human hero (the time traveller, who is never quite at home in and so rises above any period of time)--one who the audience is at least allowed to hope for--without in any way compromising the scope of Wells\' intent.<br /><br />Perhaps it is even some return trip of the time traveller to those \"horse and buggy\" days which changes the innacurate \"predictions\" to recent history as we actually know it--a possibility plainly allowed for (though not shouted out) by the screenplay. A question for familiar viewers--would Filby really just let his son Jamie die and his store be destoyed, for apparently no good reason--after having received due warning?<br /><br />The time-lapse photography for the time travel scenes are put to very good use. The visual appearance of the machine in the film, extrapolated from Wells\' descriptions, is a remarkable feat of imagination and ingenuity, and is the envy of every true sci-fi buff.  A scene where the time traveller takes a moment to gaze upon and walk about his creation before embarking on his first journey, looking on it with admiration, amazement and anticipation (as if the machine itself were a discovery more than an invention, seamlessly pregnant with the endless adventures it promises), is even breathtaking.<br /><br />The Hollywood swashbuckling and boy-meets-girl aspects are present but not overblown. The wonder of time meets technology is intelligently dealt with, as is the wonder of a man who steps out of his own time. In this respect it is very fun to watch the time traveller try to kindle the spark of curiosity and wonder in the spiritually deadened descendents of the future, who are plainly depicted as having their forerunners stemming back as far as the late 1800\'s (the time traveller having had similar trouble at that time as well, trying to wake up closed-minded friends and aquaintances as he argues with them about the value of time-travel). The near-futility of his stuggle is very forceful, vivid and effective.<br /><br />The casting is flawless and the acting is excellent, especially for the two main characters, the unnamed by Wells, \"Time Traveler\" (though very subtly given the cameo name in the film of H. George Wells--the first initial H. followed by \"George Wells\" only briefly appearing in shots of the time machine\'s control panel, where the inventor stylistically ingraved it--though his friends do call him George) and his tiny, delicate and fun-loving girlfriend from the future, Weena.<br /><br />Incidentally, the 2002 Dreamworks remake is good, but really has nothing to do with Wells\' novel.  One nice twist is the albino and articulate Morlock. Weena is still pretty, but has nothing to do with Wells\' novel--even her name gets changed to \"Mara.\" The time machine itself is also good (very good), though it is impossible to believe it was constructed in 1899.  Not so for the 1960 film; I believe it every time--\"If someone had made a time machine in 1899 that somehow actually worked, that is what it would have looked like.\"  Overall, in terms of sets and direction in the \"remake,\" the distant future does not appear as distant and exotic as in the earlier film. Distorted beyond recognition in the 2002 remake is the foreboding, silent future image of the Sphinx, towering over the time traveller when he first arrives in the year 802,701.  This image from the novel is present in 1960 film, and is intended to invoke the tantalizing theme of \"the riddle of the Sphinx\"--what is the difference between man and beast?  Yet in this remake there are few mysteries.  Overall, the film has the same failings, while at the same time being \"maverick\" gets reduced to the mundane, like wearing a hat not yet in style. Notably absent is the nearly-futile and perennial struggle of the hero.<br /><br />Does the 1960 version solve the riddle of the Sphinx?  I think it hints at a solution: at the end of the movie, the housekeeper, Mrs. Watchett (evidently a widow, but not evidently without children), befriending Filby, evidently wishes to keep the house light going in at least in one window (in case of the Time Traveller\'s return)--as such she also evidently represents the future Eloi; the scene is shot just as we must imagine that Weena is also awaiting the Time Traveller\'s return.  It is his businessmen friends who become the Morlock--though Filby is the ambiguous go between.'),(516,3,'790747324','The Croods','See this first!','I\'ve loved this movie forever and now that\'s it restored, I love it more.<br />I bought the two together to show my kids.

George Wells (named in honor or the author of the original book) is just hours from seeing another century.  But he is not satisfied with that, nor does he have to be.  He wants to go many centuries into the future.<br /><br />The H.G. Wells book this movie is based on was written in 1895 close to when this movie is set.  It was also the first story of time travel by mechanical means.  \"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur\'s Court\" written by Mark Twain six years beforehand was about time travel via a bump on the head.  In fact it was this book that coined the phrase \"time machine.\"<br /><br />The movie closely follows the book except that it takes advantage of knowledge of 20th Century history not available to writers in the 1890\'s.  When traveling into the future George stops during the two World Wars and the year 1966 which was a future year when this movie was made.  Then he narrowly escapes a nuclear blast.  This encases him and his machine in rock forcing him to continue traveling into the future until the rock was worn away over time.  He stops in the year 802,701.<br /><br />George expects to see new inventions and progress.  He is shown some advanced technology but not much.  What he first sees is a lush garden and people, all blond and young, living in leisure.  It appears that mankind has found a way back to the Garden of Eden.  But something is just not right.  For starters they do nothing when one of them is drowning in the river.  The time traveler rescues the woman whose name is Weena and asks about her people\'s \"rather curious attitude.\"<br /><br /> He finds out more about these people.  They are called the Eloi.  There are people underground called the Morlock.  But they do not look anything like the Eloi.  These Morlocks are blue skinned, big eyed, monstrous looking people.  Over time the human race has divided into two species.  The Eloi have everything provided to them by the Morlocks but they pay a price for it.  They all must eventually go underground to be eaten by the Morlocks.  They respond to a siren with the exact same sound that civil defense sirens have been sounding since the beginning of the 20th Century.  The time traveler had heard this sound during his stop in a World War II air raid and in the 1966 nuclear holocaust as people were being warned to seek shelter.  Apparently people had been so conditioned to respond to that sound by going underground that the Eloi were doing so mindlessly.<br /><br />H.G. Wells was concerned about the working class increasingly working underground.  In this story, this perceived trend of his has progressed to an extreme.  There is a lot more to this story than someone going into the future and seeing new gadgets.  On top of being a fun movie, it is rich in social commentary.  The movie gives one the experience of traveling with the main character.'),(523,13,'790747324','The Croods','Nostalgia','The Time Machine is a \"deep thought\" movie.

So he relays the story.<br /><br />A week earlier it was the turn of the century. He was showing his latest invention \"The Time Machine.\" With this machine he could go into the future or the past. Being an optimist about mans future he chose the future. The adventure begins.<br />--------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />This is the definitive time machine movie. There have been others before and others after \"Time After Time\" (1979). There has been time without machines \"Somewhere in Time\"(1980). But just as Cecil\'s \"The Ten Commandments\" (1956) is the version you remember.<br /><br />There are other remakes or versions of this story made later. The (1978) TV version which did a fair job of portraying the book even if it looked like a TV movie; Priscilla Barnes played Weena.  An earlier make of the movie (1949) Mary Donn played Weena. Then they forgot how to make movies and went to today\'s sound bit razzle-dazzle shallow version (2002) hopefully not the last attempt, looks like Weena is out too.<br /><br />Rod Taylor\'s time machine is the one that you remember. An interesting side note is that in the book \"The Time Machine\" by H. G. Wells, Weena was not much worth messing around with and defiantly did not look like Yvette Mimieux.<br /><br />Later in the story mankind breaks into two species. The interesting part is that in the book the reason was social. In this movie it is war and the A-bomb. In future movies it is eugenics. Given today\'s climate it will probably be social again.<br /><br />Any way I want the fancy time machine and a Morlock suit.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005K9O7\">The Sticky Fingers of Time</a>'),(526,13,'790747324','The Croods','When Sci-fi actually interested me','This film was made before CG, before Star Wars and Star Trek and all those other sci-fi films that seem to be wholly about lasers and do-dads and weird looking aliens.  See, I never liked science fiction.  I found it to be too nerdy, lacking heart and soul, more concerned with gadgetry and amazingly complicated story lines and stuff I just couldn\'t relate to.  What I didn\'t realize is that there is sci-fi for me: the classics.  This was when the emphasis was on the fiction, this was when sci-fi could serve as an allegory to man\'s plight in the universe, peeling back the layers of what makes us human while carefully masking it\'s message behind some entertainment.  The time machine is one of these films.  I first saw it in sixth grade, many years ago and remembered being surprised about liking it (again, don\'t like sci-fi).  But this film has some great characters, performances, something to say without saying it, and some great old effects (again, cg takes me right out of a film, it\'s just more inventive here if a bit cheesy).  THe picture looks great so I\'d definately recommend buying it.<br /><br />But the real reason to buy it is the behind the scenes featurette. It is simply hillarious.  I have never laughed so hard at a featurette.  The pacing is what got to me, the singular fixation on the prop of the time machine rather than an in-depth explanation of the film, the creepy way Rod Taylor looks up to talk to the deceased George Pal, when one of the actors just stares into the camera talking to the audience in character with a slow zoom into his face, the \"what-if\" scene at the end, the random inclusion of material and the shoving in of the title card every once and awhile.  It\'s like listening to your grandfather tell you a story about his favorite chair.  It\'s comic genius (not to be disrespectful to any involved but all seemed highly staged and organized so I feel that I\'m not insulting them when I say that)<br /><br />Favorite line: Rod Taylor: \"And so the time machine lives on, in Back to the Future promos and other various appearences\"<br /><br />Trust me, this thing is genius.

All of it is true! For some reason this film ties into the imagination and fills you with wonder. We can thank Mr. Wells for creating the story, but we really owe it to George Pal, Wah Chang and Gene Warren for translating the book into a miracle of romantic adventure. The real draw of course is &quot;The Time Machine&quot; prop. Never in the history of film has a prop been more imitated and desired. The special effects received an Academy Award and it was well deserved. All of the elements of Victorian London in winter, cozy parlors surrounded with friends gathered for dinner, &quot;tea table&quot; chat over the 4th dimension and the recollection of an experiment in time travel utilizing a flashback technique are what makes this film so enchanting. When Rod Taylor finally begins a slow initial journey we see the sky in motion in day and night sequences that are breathtaking in astronomic splendor. As the flowered garden and fruit trees go through their seasonal cycles in rapid progression you cannot help but be drawn into the wonder of creation and the genius of invention! The screenwriters then play with your imagination as we see our traveler stop at different events in our 20th century past and a &quot;cold war&quot; interpretation of the decade in which it was filmed when he stops in the &quot;future&quot; on August 18th, 1966 to witness a nuclear holocaust. From here we are quickly transported to the focal point of the Wells story to a future society of Eloi and Morlock culture. The care that went into this DVD should not be understated. It is a highly polished film that restores 20/20 vision to the frames so that we can see all of the colorful beauty that was originally there. Once again, we can SEE the atomic satellite zeroing in, the clear sky above the Eloi &quot;cafeteria&quot; and the smoking machinery of the Morlock caverns. When our traveler returns to 1899 and presents the flower to Filby that was given to him by Weena you will agree that &quot;that flower could not have possibly bloomed in the winter time&quot; and in the holding of that flower you will realize that this is a magic moment in film that will be with you forever and as Mrs. Watchit gradually turns off the lights in our view from the snowy evening outside you will think about the three books you would have taken and agree that having seen this film you will never be the same again, because you are in love with a romantic idea, TIME TRAVEL.'),(529,13,'790747324','The Croods','Review for &quot;The Time Machine&quot;','The Time Machine had a great effect on me. I found it to be enjoyable and it had very fascinating theories throughout. What I liked most in the book was the interesting characters, H.G. Wells\' style of writing, the parallel of Eloi and Morlocks to society now, how the book always kept my attention, and finally I liked how the narrator left us questioning the conclusion of the novel.<br />  First, I liked how interesting the characters were simply because that is a vital aspect to a good novel. I was impressed by the Time Traveller, and how he was determined to prove his machine to be a success. The characters whom attended his dinners always seemed a little skeptical of his ideas and theories. The Time Traveller explains his discovery of the fourth-dimension and the Psychologist interrupts stating,&quot;You can move about in all directions of space, but you cannot move about in Time&quot; (III.13.16).<br />  The second thing I liked about the novel was the authors\' style of writing. Wells remained descriptive throughout the book. For a novel based on imagination and theories, I found it important that Wells had kept some reality in it. (Reality being the descriptive details in the novel.) With all these crazy ideas going on in the book, Wells had to keep our minds somewhat intact to what his visions were. The Time Traveller describes the Eloi\'s as being &quot;very beautiful and graceful creatures, but indescribably frail. His flushed face reminded me of the more beautiful kind of consumptive-that hectic beauty of which we used to hear so much&quot;(III.34.33.)<br />  Another aspect of the novel I enjoyed, was the parallel of the Eloi and Morlocks to society now. We begin to understand that the Eloi and Morlocks are humans after great evolution and time. It amazed me to see how society completely divided itself between graceful creatures and creatures of the underworld.<br />  The fourth thing I liked was how the book kept my attention the whole way through. I constantly wanted to know what was going to happen next or how the Time Traveller was going to escape the Morlocks and get back to his machine.<br />  Finally, I really enjoyed how the narrator concludes the Time Travellers disappearance. The narrator says,&quot;The Time Traveller vanished three years ago. And, as everybody knows now, he has never returned&quot;(XII.124.18). I liked this because it made you question whether the Time Traveller had vanished into the future forever, whether he had always been from a past time and had gone back, or what was to come of him?

In the lead you have Rod Taylor starring as inventor H.G. Wells, a man seeking relief from, and improvement of, the world in which he lives.  Demonstrating a miniature version of his time machine for a trio of friends (including Sebastian Cabot of \"Family Affair\" fame) on New Year\'s Eve 1899, he laments that he was born in the wrong time...and that he would like to journey into the future to live among more civilized peoples.  He desires the utopia that he thinks technology will inevitably bring, but also cries out at the corruption of technology for other than peaceful purposes.<p>His journey, however, leaves him feeling overwhelmed as it is far from what he expects.  He initially watches the years go by from his machine as represented by a manequin he observes in a shop window across the street.  There, he views what he regards as a harbinger of societal descent into a more liberal way of life.  As fashions change dramatically over the decades, he blushingly remarks, \"You call that a dress?\".  He makes three intermediate stops on his way to his ultimate destination--the first in 1917, the second in 1940, and the third in 1964.  They all, conveniently, coincide with raging wars (the final one, a ficticious World War III fought with nuclear weapons that lasts for 326 years).  <p>Embittered and frightened, he moves on, ultimately coming to a stop some 800,000 years in the future.  Wells is initially delighted with his new-found utopia and attempts to befriend the native Eloi, a blond-haired, blue-eyed, fair-skinned Aryan race of humans.  He is quickly repulsed as he sees them passively watch as one of their own (Weena, played by the lovely Yvette Mimieux) starts to drown only a few feet from the others.  After saving her, he learns that they are nothing more than a race of slow-witted, cowardly do-nothings who rely on the sinister Morlocks for survival.  <p>The Morlocks, who look like a cross between the Hulk and the gill man on \"The Creature from the Black Lagoon,\" were the humans who chose to continue living underground after the end of the last war.  They deevolved physically and morally and, as a result, developed into ravenous cannibals who fattened up the Eloi so as to devour them at a later date (eating the oldest ones first).<p>There is no written word within either culture and that lends itself to the theory that cultures tend to stagnate without the written word.  Without books there is no learning beyond pure observation and word of mouth and, in this case, both races eventually lost whatever skills and knowledge they once possessed.<p>Eventually, the Eloi and Morlocks took on a primitive symbiotic relationship.  You have the peace-loving, vegetarian, let-nature-take-its-course Eloi one one side, and the militaristic (they still use air raid sirens to hypnotize the Eloi), meat-eating (of a sort), control-your-own-destiny Morlocks.  Despite his appreciation for much of the Eloi philosophy--he initially mistakes them for economic genuises--he quickly realizes the truth about them and grows disgusted with their apathetic attitude towards self-improvement and advancement.<br /><br />Ironically, circumstances dictate him teaching the Eloi the value of fighting (back), a trait he abhorred.  As a result, the Eloi defeat the Morlock in a demonstration that while war may be bad it can also be the LESSER of two evils.  Still, after their victory, the Eloi are left to answer the question \"How do we fend for ourselves now?\".  Wells chooses to stay among them, returning to his time only long enough to retrieve three books to help them in their journey.  In the final scene of the movie, one of the inventor\'s friends discusses Well\'s future with Well\'s housekeeper.  He finally asks her (and the audience), \"Which three books would you have chosen?\".<p>The film confronts the positives and negatives of pacifism vs. militarism and, in an overall generic sense, liberalism vs. conservatism, all with regard to the survival and growth of a society.  Eventually, the movie shows that raging examples of either philosophy isn\'t the solution--that the true solution resides closer to the middle of the spectrum (with the pendulum tilting into conservative territory.<p>The story is timeless, the script and acting good, and George Pal\'s special effects excellent considering the age of the movie.

They cleverly illustrated the passage of time as the time machine traveled through the fourth dimension by utilizing a number of clever devices such as; rapidly growing and ripening apples over what appeared to be seconds, shrinking candlesticks as we watched, a mannequin that changed with the fashions as we watched, the sun and moon arcing overhead in a heartbeat, superfast appearing snails, rapidly decomposing morlochs and much more.<br /><br />Rod Taylor as H.G. Wells did play a rather bare knuckled hero, but he showed conviction and passion in the role that helped to suspend our disbelief. Yvette Mimieux as Weena, a young blond Eloi, was quite a scene stealer without doing anything special in particular. Perhaps she just looked the part of a young eloi woman so well and attractively that it made Rod Taylor\'s character want to stay in the future an easy sell for both him and the audience.

G Wells Sci Fi Story','The 1960 film version of \"The Time Machine\", was always one of my absolute favourites growing up and rewatching it now as an adult I appreciate now even more the great effort put in by the legendary George Pal and his talented cast and technical crew in bringing this story vividly to life. Their attention to detail, and creation of what are still awe inspiring special effects were of course created using their collective imaginations without the help of today\'s computers. I\'m not going into exclamations as others have about the effects appearing \"dated\", by today\'s standards as that is a pointless exercise and really why is there a need to compare efforts such as this made in 1960 with the technology available to movie makers today? I look at the film in the context of the time it was made in and in this way it can be seen that \"The Time Machine\", was very state of the art entertainment upon its release. Using the excellent literary source in the famous novel by H.G. Wells, MGM studios in a last gasp of its famous move making finesse fashioned an exciting, thought provoking, and above all else spectacular story here that looks as fresh today as it did over 45 years ago. What is so totally impressive about this film version still for me is the marvellous depiction of the passage of time once the story gets under way and this progression by Rod Taylor on his time machine from New Years Eve 1899 through many thousands of years into Earth\'s future is still one of the greatest science fiction sequences ever filmed in any decade. George Pal\'s brilliance in visual design is wonderfully evident in every frame of these scenes where he shows the passing of time by the continual speeded up rising and setting of the sun and moon and best of all by a wonderful idea of continually showing the clothes on a mannequin standing in a neighboring shop window continually changing as the fashions progress over many decades. The time machine itself is a wonderful piece of movie making design and in the decades since the film\'s release has really taken on a whole life of its own as probably one of the most famous movie props ever created. For all sci fi film lovers like myself this wonderful piece of imaginative construction along with the whole classic movie to which it belongs has assumed an appropriately timeless quality and illustrates yet again the genius that was movie maker George Pal.'),(570,24,'790747324','The Croods','An Interesting Adaptation','H. G. Wells\' The Time Machine is another of the great George Pal movies which did so much to bring science fiction to the big screen.  Naturally, the movie is based on H. G. Well\'s book \"The Time Machine\", which was first published in 1895.  However, there is a significant change between the movie and the book.  In the book, Wells focused on a class struggle which ultimately resulted in the separation between the Eloi and the Morlocks.  The movie, though, is about war.  The main character George (a.k.a. H. G. Wells) stops at three places in time, each of them being a major conflict; World War I, World War II, and the last a nuclear war which George Pal places in the year 1966, just six years after the movie.<br /><br />The movie debuted in Japan on June 10th of 1960, before moving on to the U.S. on August 17th of the same year.  The movie stars Rod Taylor as George, with Alan Young playing David Filby and James Filby (father and son), Yvette Mimieux as Weena, and Sebastian Cabot as Dr. Hillyer.  This movie, along with \"Destination Moon\", \"When Worlds Collide\", and \"War of the Worlds\" are classics produced by George Pal, which defined science fiction in the movies.  After \"The Time Machine\", Pal turned his talents to fantasy, producing films like \"Atlantis, the Lost Continent\", \"The Wonderful World of the Brothers Grimm\", and the wonderful and bizarre \"7 Faces of Dr. Lao\".'),(571,17,'790747324','The Croods','Out of the nowhere, into the here','In the 1960\'s, when movie making was still an art form, master puppeteer, George Pal created what has been considered a true classic, The Time Machine. Selecting as his hero, the handsome, gritty and debonair Austrialian actor Rod Taylor, playing Herbert George Wells, the director accurately portrays the adventurous, but moody, Victorian as a gentleman, who dabbles with inventions and yearns for a more peaceful century to live in. Using what has been hailed as the best special effects of that date, Pal launches Taylor into the future. Stopping only to observe the changing eras where war is fought with better and more sophisticated weapons, Wells finally arrives in the land of the Eloi. Here he meets beautiful and sultry Weena (Yvette Mimieux) and her people. During their brief time together, Weena allows Wells to learn that despite their idyllic paradise, it is not without dangers. In this future, it\'s the Morlocks who have become the masters of the world and have stolen Wells\' time machine. Doomed to spend eternity in the future, Taylor engages in battle with the Morlocks resulting in a story he will later relate to David Filby (Alan Young) and his Victorian friends.

It was going to be difficult to please everyone, but amazingly it did.<br /><br />The idea of using time travel in movies has been done and redone; I think of the movies \"Back to the Future\", \"Peggy Sue got Married\", and many many more, but for me this is one of the better done ones, because<br /><br />1st.  The movie talks about searching for a greater good.  It\'s not just a story of humor, or vaneness, or someone trying to get out of trouble.

About the futility of human achievement, and ultimately, about how human kindness is the one thing that survives when all else is lost. In that story, one human being was just a cog in the wheel of time, and had little power to change anything.<p>But the movie...ah the movie was about something else entirely. Look past the excellent special effects and the (in my book anyway) great acting and flow of plot. What do you have? A story about the suffering of humanity. The striving for knowledge and improvement. And the idea that if people allow themselves to stagnate, to become complacent, and to forget the mistakes of the past, they may allow their world to turn into a nightmare rather than the Utopia they long for. In this movie, one human being CAN make a difference. The time traveler helps the people of the future to rediscover their courage, their compassion, their humanity.

George did an equally good job with \"The Time Machine\".<p>Herbert Wells wonders about the evolution of society and looks forward into the future at the great things man will accomplish.  The drive to see that great future has driven Herbert to create a machine to get there.  One aspect I enjoyed about this movie and \"Time after Time\" is that Herbert in each movie was interested in the progress of society and man.  Their action with the time machine was the equivalent of turning to the last chapter of a novel.<p>In this movie, Herbert finds that society has been destroyed by a nuclear war, which in 1960 seemed like a very real and imminent possibility.  Mankind was driven underground by the need to escape the effects of the war, leading ultimately to the evolution of the peaceful Eloi and the predatory Morlocks.  The Morlocks principal source of food seems to be the Eloi, while the Eloi eat fruits and vegetables, which inadvertently becomes a commentary on what happens to vegetarians.<p>George Pal tries hard and generally succeeds in exploiting what happens when a society no longer has a need to drive itself to achieve a goal, whatever that goal may be.  The Eloi have everything provided, so they see no need to strive to be any different.  Things are the way they have always been, and life if good.  If some disappear occasionally, well, we can still go play by the rocks and do whatever.  Obviously some of this story is difficult to believe because we know that even \"peaceful\" animals such as rams and bulls sometimes fight to the [end] over females and territory, and it would seem like there would be some point of contention even in this \"perfect\" society.  However, given that the movie has to present a viewpoint in a relatively small time frame, it succeeds well by the very exaggeration of the characteristics of such a society.<p>The end of the movie is most satisfying, as Alan Young (playing George Well\'s best friend Philby), speculates on three books that George took with him to help re-build the civilization of the far future.<p>While the movie suffers from many of the cliches and the now dated styling of the late 1950s, it creates a very believably little tale with award winning special effects.  At the end of the movie you are left with the sense that mankind has the ability to triumph over the odds.  I am admittedly partial to these classics, which did so much with so little, requiring much plot creativity.  However, when the end credits roll, you walk out satisfied that you were treated to a real movie experience.<p>While I should give this movie 4 stars for its weak points, it gets 5 stars for standing the tests of time and being better than the 2002 re-make.'),(582,27,'790747324','The Croods','Another George Pal Classic!','I saw this movie in 1960 at a drive-in, and it so impressed me that I stayed to see it again!

Pal would go on to make &quot;The 7 Faces of Dr. Lao&quot; in 1964, but his most thoughtful film (in my opinion) will forever be &quot;The Time Machine&quot;. <p>Going back to H.G. Wells, Pal insures a Victorian sentimentality that would\'ve been present if the film had been made during the era in which it was written. Taking place on the literal eve of the new (20th) century, inventor George (Rod Taylor) invites a group of his friends to witness a demonstration of his new invention. When they arrive, they don\'t believe in the Time Machine that he has created. Even his best friend, Filby (delightfully played by Alan Young) has his doubts. Uninterested, they leave him to celebrate the new era. <p>Determined to travel through time, George uses the machine himself to find what\'s left of human civilization in the far future. (After fleeing World Wars and puzzling fashons.) He expects to find a Utopia, and he finds one of sorts - but it is not the paradise he expected. George discovers he must defend and teach these valueless humans (including the beautiful Weena played by Yvette Mimieux), lest they die out forever. <p>The film is an allegory for the rapidly diminishing Victorian mentality at the turn of the century, and George finds that his imagination and spirit of adventure are outdated within his own lifetime. &quot;The Time Machine&quot; not only reflects the spirit of Wells\' own work but the swashbuckling fiction of the time, made whole with a sense of hope and empathy representing the perfect Victorian gentleman hero. This really is 19th Century science fiction at its best: filled with adventure, romance and in the end - depth.  <p>(This review refers to the BOX SET COLLECTORS EDITION which features a 35mm film clip, a Senitype image from the film, lobby cards and black &amp; white stills, a 27&quot; x 40&quot; original one-sheet and the original H.G.

Unfortunately!!!','I can understand if a viewer has only seen a VHS release of this film, worse still a rental copy, that this DVD would probably exceed expectations. Some of us though have seen the Laserdisc as well so our expectations of the DVD were a little higher. Frankly, I think Warner has given \"The Time Machine\" a better than average transfer for Warner. I also don\'t think that is saying much either. The aspect ratio is off, details at Amazon.com give it 1:66:1, but Widescreen review is giving it as 1:78:1, which is closer to what you see on the screen. So little is made of the widescreen field however, that a fullscreen editon would probably enhance details in the center, especially Yvette Mimieux and Rod Taylor who give wonderful performances in this film. This is probably why I enjoyed the film on television so much over the years. I found the sound passable but the dialogue too soft at times. The picture succumbed to grain a little to often, but it\'s certainly better than it has looked in years. The lack of any running commentary is probably what is really missing on this otherwise decent DVD edition. It would have been better still if they had issued the Pan and Scan edition on the second layer or flip side with this Widescreen editon.  Instead, we get as a supplemental a nearly decade old 45 minute TV program, much of its footage is far older, fuzzy and faded, hosted by Rod Taylor.  He had changed so much that I didn\'t recognise him at first. I understand this is yet another MGM title which Warners is issuing on DVD after getting the rights from Turner. I think MGM makes better DVD\'s for the same or even less money than Warner from what I have seen so far. I hope to be pleasantly surprised otherwise in the future, but we will see.

In particular, the sense of history passing so quickly, seeing where the path of man might lead.

But, I\'ve also seen it several times since on VHS. (I\'m new to DVD so I can neither praise nor criticize the techno dis- or advantages of that new medium.)<p>I\'ve read the H. G. Wells novella several times and, like most people, I guess, have occasional fantasies of time travel. Years after I\'d first seen the film, I had a minor criticism, that the novella had more \"socialist\" undertones. The Eloi and the Morlocks had parted special ways due to economic oppression, i.e., the latter being imprisoned in mines and factories so long that they  became a troglyditic, brutal, predatory species while the former were weak, meek, ignorant, and the prey of the Morlocks. The film depoliticized that to a degree.<p>In retrospect, that depoliticization (forgive the long word) may have been necessary for the movie market of the time. The anti-communist fervor still existed then. What\'s more, to make the story more meaningful to the young viewers, the producers and screen writers may have left out that which seemed more appropriate to Wells\' time.<p>And there WAS politics, appropriate to the time. For instance, the air raid alarm went off and the Eloi went into a trance to march to the dinner tables of the Morlocks. In other words, the original meaning of that alarm had been lost after thousands of centuries of distortion.<p>The characters were adequate, though I still find it hard to see Rod Taylor as an Englishman. Other leading characters went on to roles such as the lead human character in \"Mr. Ed,\" and Giles French, the genial butler in \"Family Affair.\"<br />In any event, the special effects were superbly done, the story well executed. I could criticize the simplistic romance of Yvette Mimieux\'s character, but the rest of the story overshadowed that. And, as others have pointed out, there was a challenge to \"realism,\" what one would expect after 8000 centuries. But the \"li cense of the medium,\" and the points of the story make up for those weaknesses. Neither Wells nor the producers intended  historical realism. <p>And one cannot help but be amused by the futurist speculation, e.g., a nuclear war beginning in 1966. Again, that was a overwhelming fear in the year the film was made and seemed all too possible. <p>Because I\'ve so loved this film for the last 42 (!) years, I asked my wife for the soundtrack and for the \"remake\" (if that\'s what it is) from Amazon.com for Christmas.

Wells, about an inventor who builds a machine that enables him to travel through time, specifically into the future, where he learns a timeless, universal truth about the machinations of society and some of the basic tenets of human nature.  \"The Time Machine,\" which Pal produced and directed, stars Rod Taylor as George, the inventor/time traveler/hero, who, born into a time and world that doesn\'t suit him, decides to do something about it.  <p>...<p> Going into this project, George Pal had a definite vision of what he wanted to accomplish with this film, from the way the time machine itself looked, to the way he wanted to present the future of mankind and the world.  And working from the intelligent, imaginative screenplay by David Duncan, he succeeded by delivering a film that has since become a classic of the Science Fiction genre.  The nature of the story demands that the viewer suspend disbelief, of course, but Pal develops his story in such a plausible, straightforward manner that it is easy to do just that.  He puts George on the journey of a lifetime, and he takes his audience along for the ride.  He does an exquisite job of establishing the Victorian era in which the story begins, as well as the world of the Eloi and the Morlocks.  The F/X he employs to convey the sense of George\'s movement through time-- like the swift arcing of the Sun and Moon, and the quick, subtle (and sometimes not-so-subtle) changes George observes-- are entirely effective.  Pal obviously had a devotion to detail that pays off handsomely here.  A dedicated filmmaker, he refused to settle for less than what he knew was right for his picture, and it shows.  The result is a film that is entertaining, timeless and memorable.<p> As George, Rod Taylor is perfectly cast and gives a solid performance in which he embodies the boldness, the imagination and tenacity of his character.  Most importantly, he makes George believable and his motivations credible, which enables the viewer to be swept along with the story.  Taylor has a commanding presence that serves his character well, and he is, in fact, the veritable personification of the explorer/adventurer, a man willing to take a chance or face unbelievable odds to accomplish his goal.  Taylor is a fine actor who has made a number of movies, but of them all, this is the role for which he will probably be best remembered.<p> Also perfect in her role is Yvette Mimieux, as one of the Eloi, Weena.  A talented actress-- now something of a `60s icon, in fact-- her fair beauty, along with the innocent demeanor and vulnerability she manages to convey, makes her character entirely convincing.  And the way she plays it makes George\'s actions more likely, as well.  Granted, her character is well written to begin with, but Mimieux\'s the one who sells it in the translation from page to screen.  <p> The supporting cast includes Doris Lloyd (Mrs. Watchett), Bob Barran (Eloi Man), James Skelly (Second Eloi Man) and Paul Frees (Voice of the Talking Rings).  A transporting flight of fantasy, expertly crafted and imaginatively presented, \"The Time Machine\" is captivating entertainment that will make you believe that time travel is possible.  it paints a bleak picture of the future, to be sure, but it gives you and leaves you with that which has kept Man putting one foot in front of the other since Time began:  Hope.

In George Pal\'s THE TIME MACHINE, the time traveller George (Rod Taylor) can put the audience at ease with a smile or gentlemanly act of gallantry and can in a flash revert to the traditional role of derring doer whenever a pretty damsel is in need.  The recent (2002) version of this film with Guy Pearce in the title role has too much of special effects and not enough of the hero.  George Pal wisely allows his time traveller not to play second banana to the then (1960) special effects that wowed the viewer without distracting him.<br />  George is a scientist who on the last day of the 19th century wishes to prove to his circle of doubting friends that time travel is not only possible but practicable.  There is a charming scene in which he lectures to them on the fourth dimension, culminating with a mini-time machine model that takes a cigar to the future.  This scene functions as a necessary segue to the larger model that will carry him to his unknown future.  Alan Young and Sebastian Cabot have minor but significant roles in that they set the tone that this movie is more about the relationships between people than it is between man and novel technology. George zooms to the far future where he encounters a race of humans (the Eloi) who have degenerated morally into a blandly hedonistic group of blonde but not too adventuresome weaklings who are opposed by equally degenerate atavistic green-skinned Neanderthals who see the Eloi only as food.  This division of humanity into opposite sides of the same Jekyll and Hyde persona forces George into an ugly choice: he must decide which race is the better carrier of its ancient lineage.  This decision is not as obvious as it may seem on first glance.  The Eloi look more human but lack the moral fiber to take a stand even on issues related to their survival.  The Morlocks certainly are ugly enough to arouse repulsion, but they nevertheless possess the drive to succeed and the ability to propagate their species.  An Eloi female Weena (Yvette Mimieux) helps George to decide in favor of the Eloi.  Yet, part of the success for this movie is the subtext that though appearances of humans and even humanoids may vary through evolution, each grouping and subgrouping of species cannot be judged on a broad cloth of value.  It is to the individual member that imbues that species with its collective identity.  The Eloi, for all their lack of purpose, fighting spirit, and drive to succeed, managed to win out over their more bestial competitors--this time.  But the ending leaves the viewer that this victory of surface humanity over surface inhumanity may not be assuring enough to convince George, the Eloi themselves or the viewer that such success will continue no matter how far into the future George may go.'),(609,14,'790747324','The Croods','Good sci-fi movie...

Many of my old friends from the neighborhood took the trek up to Fordham Road to see this movie with me and were not dissapointed with this great film. Although the special effects are a little dated they are nevertheless still effective.  The movie owes much of its success to the original Wells story.'),(612,15,'790747324','The Croods','A Thought-Provoking Film That Looks Better Than Ever On DVD','Boy, did a nice DVD transfer like this one  not only make me appreciate the visuals in here more but made the story seem better, too, for some reason. I only acquired the DVD as a memento, so to speak. I had to have at least one movie which had the woman I had a crush on back in the early \'60s: Yvettte Mimieux. She still looks great, too.<br /><br />Since time travel stories also fascinate me, my favorite part of the film is when \"George\" (Rod Taylor) is actually in his time machine and experiments with it, slowing it down here and then and then stopping it a couple of times to observe World War I and then WWII. Then, he stops in 1966 when supposedly there was a nuclear attack. (Apparently, scare-mongers back in \'60 thought that was a short-term likelihood.)<br /><br />Anyway, when \"George\" (H.G. Wells, the author of this story) finally stops, in the year 200,000-something, the story loses some of its momentum. However, it\'s a fairly interesting study of a group of ultra-passive people being dominated by others who live underground and then literally eat the good people. Taylor is astounded that mankind has not progressed as he had figured but seemed to have regressed.<br /><br />The message I got on this last look is that man is still man, meaning sinful and capable of anything bad as well as good, and to put one\'s faith totally in man is a mistake. It\'s only going to lead to disappointments as \"George\" found out on each of his stops. (Notice he never stopped during a peaceful, progressive period.) Yet, \"George\" is still an optimist and wants to be one to help initiate change for the better. There\'s always hope for a better world and people like George, with his idealism put to action, can make a difference.<br /><br />Overall, an entertaining and thought-provoking film.'),(613,21,'790747324','The Croods','Time machine Review','This is one of the best movies ever made.

In an gathering of his friends, he demonstrates a scale model of what he says is a time machine.  Except for his friend Filby  (played by a finely nuanced Alan Young) those gathered don\'t believe him.<br /><br />Unsuspected by all but Filby, George has built a full-scale model.

A nice touch is the nameplate on the control panel.  It says, \"Built by H. George Wells\".<br /><br />The special effects were state-of-the-art for 1960 winning an Academy Award for best special effects.  Even today, the effects fit neatly into the story.<br /><br />This is a mid-twentieth century cinematic interpretation of a nineteenth century novel.  The David Duncan screenplay `updates\' the story brilliantly. While George Pal\'s films have a well-deserved reputation for technical excellence, the acting has been uneven.  That is not the case in this movie.  Mr. Taylor is totally believable as the idealistic inventor searching for a better world.  Yvette Mimieux is Weena, of the sheep-like Eloi who begins to think as result of meeting George.<br /><br />The DVD I have has an excellent documentary on the making of the film narrated by Mr. Taylor.<br /><br />If you interested in a great SF adventure movie, this one is essential to your collection.'),(617,16,'790747324','The Croods','TIME MACHINE OF THE GODS','This is the book Sylvester McCoy is reading as 1996\'s DOCTOR WHO---THE MOVIE begins.

Wells), and Yvette Mimieux in a very early role (interestingly, she became an anthropologist, the study of which has a concern in the overall plot development and socio-political points Wells was trying to drive home with his novel).<br /><br />The plot follows Wells\' late Victorian novel fairly well.  Scientist George invents a time machine, and after making the proclamation to several of his nay-saying friends, including a test with a miniature time machine, takes off on a few journeys.  The early journeys are just to test, and we see a few fascinating effects here.  But the greater story lies in George\'s hope for the future, so he sets himself to go nearly a million years in to the future - the year 802701.<br /><br />Trivia buffs will recognise the date on the machine as October 12, the same date Columbus discovered the new world.  George embarks into this new world, finding the human race has evolved into a split species - the above-ground Eloi, and the below-ground Morlochs.  The Eloi are carefree airheads for the most part - that is, until the Morlochs threaten, and then they become the hunted.  The Morlochs are presented as base creatures, following only their appetites, and afraid to remain above for too long.<br /><br />The effects of the time machine itself and the transition scenes are quite good for the time - I recall as a child watching this film on television and being mesmerised by the passage of time, the scenery changes through George\'s window as the time streamed by, and the contrast between the Victorian household set and the future world.<br /><br />The more recent remake did homage to this classic film by incorporating a few of the same ideas - the scene changes through the windows, for example.  Also, Alan Young (who played Filby in the 1960 film) appeared in the more recent film, the only actor to appear in both.<br /><br />George has a tough decision to make - his time machine is stolen by the Morlochs; does he risk his life to get it back?

In 2007 I said of Petrillo\'s performance in that vastly better (!) production \"...be advised that Sammy Petrillo may be the most annoying man in show business,\" and in retrospect that was generous. \"Keyholes are for Peeping\" features Petrillo in a dual role: he plays Stanley Bebble, nerdy newly-minted marriage counselor, and Mrs. Bebble, his mother. The obvious reason to see this would be because it was made by Doris \"Nude on the Moon\" Wishman, and after watching this disaster you will be pining for the moon dolls (even the one in the disgusting brown outfit.) I have certainly not seen her entire catalogue, but this almost certainly has to be Wishman\'s worst (I hope so, anyhow.)<br /><br />This transfer of the film is horrendous, but I can\'t imagine it looked good right from the processor in 1972. The lighting and locations are among the ugliest and most depressing I have ever seen (note especially the early dream sequence,) but the costumes and hair are even worse. Worst of all is the script and acting, which is a career low for all involved. Pacing is nonexistent, nobody has even remotely rational or realistic actions, and the best performance is from Cocoa Stahl, who is a dog. No really, she\'s a canine. The story is pure Wishman, and finds Stanley as a marriage counselor who can\'t get his own life together with his fianc&eacute;e Katie (Kristen Steen,) despite all the various plot distractions of the film. Even the interrupted vacuum cleaner scene, which is intended to be titillating, can\'t make this film fun. Nor can the worst (and least suggestive) shower scene I can ever recall seeing.<br /><br />Stanley hangs out a shingle and starts giving out business cards (handwritten business cards typically captivate the highest paying customers, I hear.) He has to overcome problems with Katie and his mother, and deal with Manuel (Philip Stahl,) the building superintendent of the New York dump who is also the peeper-in-chief. As an aside, I hope you like vaudeville music and slide whistles, because if you do, you will want to buy the soundtrack; if you don\'t you will want to invest in earplugs. The film is supposedly risqu&eacute; and I imagine it would still get an \"R\" today, but believe me when I tell you there is nothing enjoyable about the tawdriness of this film. At all. A better title might have been \"Ugly People in Terrible Situations.\"<br /><br />Eventually Stanley gets two couples on the hook for group therapy, and after counseling Cocoa (I\'m not kidding,) the onscreen action turns positively oily, and the film devolves to a huge fracas where Katie and Manuel join in the maelstrom of physical and situation comedy that wraps up the movie in a totally predictable, yet offputtingly seedy way that will make you want to take a long shower (cold is fine.)<br /><br />\"Keyholes are for Peeping\" is an abomination, and the transfer is its equal. While Wishman was a true pioneer and had an unnatural ability to make oddly risqu&eacute; films, everything about this film is poor, most significantly casting Sammy Petrillo in the lead: in \"Bela Lugosi Meets a Brooklyn Gorilla\" he comes across as an impoverished man\'s imitation Jerry Lewis, here his long hair and need for some cosmetic dentistry (especially unappealing in drag) make this an absolute chore to watch.

While the Ebert\'s and Roeper\'s are constantly invited to big premiere\'s and likely never lay out one single dime to view a movie, it is us; the paying customers, whose dimes make or break a film. That being said, I have put my foot in my mouth in the past when discussing certain actors. Up til now, I\'ve always felt Tom Cruise to be overrated and nothing more than eye candy for starstruck females.<p>As a mere movie fan, I feel as if every actor who achieves greatness has their definitive film that catches my attention and convinces me that they are more than I bargained for. Robert Deniro had &quot;Raging Bull&quot;. Ray Liotta had &quot;Goodfellas&quot;. Johnny Depp had &quot;Donnie Brasco&quot;. Denzel Washington had &quot;Malcolm X&quot;. Now, after years of consistently maintaining that Tom Cruise had no more acting talent than a dead carp, &quot;The Last Samurai&quot; has fully inserted foot into my mouth.<p>Actually, I should take a small step back. Within the past year, I have come to learn that Tom Cruise had personally help finance films that he saw that were running into trouble in the home stretch. When things began to look somewhat grim, Tom Cruise helped get &quot;Lock, Stock And Two Smoking Barrels&quot; and &quot;Narc&quot; into American theaters and as a huge fan of both movies, I felt a need to tip my hat to Mr. Cruise for getting those movies attention that they may not otherwise had received. Like me, Tom Cruise was a fan on movies first and I respect that. However, I had yet to see his acting work turn me fully around. &quot;The Last Samurai&quot; changed that forever.<p>In short, Tom Cruise plays a Civil War Captain who has nightmares of murdering innocent Native Americans in battle. These nightmares feed his obvious drinking problem. He is offered a job for 4 times his regular pay to sail to Japan and train an army to battle the remains of the ancient samurai. Despite their inability to perform, the new Japanese army marches into battle prematurely and amidst a stampede by the samurai, he is captured alive.<p>During his captivity, he meets Katsumoto and through the winter months, he  slowly grows to understand their culture and their respect for life and death. All of this is climaxed in the final battle when he rides out in battle as a samurai with Katsumoto in what ends up being probably the greatest battle scene ever committed to film or at least on par with that of the Lord Of The Rings trilogy. <p>The acting by the entire cast is superb. Tom Cruise\'s transformation from tragic figure to hardened warrior is nothing short of flawless. The respectful manner in which the samurai is portrayed takes you back into a period in history where you clearly witness a clash of civilizations. One of the finest ways that this is captured is the poetic and ballet-esque motion of the battle sequences. One can tell immediately that the director went to great lengths to avoid having this film be categorized as merely another &quot;samurai flick&quot;. It is instead a great, epic film about a culture that was driven into the annals of history and all but forgotten about.<p>The total package includes a supplement disc containing a virtual well of special features that take you on a stunning detailed ride behind the camera with interviews, historical comparisons, costume and set designs and training for battle sequences.

Tom Cruise also did a very good job in adapting for this role unlike other movies of his. After seeing other movies of his I was somewhat disappointed by his perfomrances. After purchasing a book about the making of this movie, it explained very well all the details as to what when into the making of this movie from choosing locations, costume design, history of the Samurai and other details. From reading this it not only shows that Tom Cruise put forth countless hours in preparing for this movie as an actor and at the same time displaying respect for the Japanese culture.<p>Special mention undoubtedly goes to both Koyuki and newcomer to me Hiroyuki Sanada. Though I have never seen Hiroyuki san myself while I was in Japan for the last eleven years, his performance fell nothing short of spectacular. As for Koyuki san, most of her roles in Japan have been those of Japanese dramas where she obvioulsy speaks her native tounge.

A washed up and aggressive western barbarian is civilized by the natives and comes to the blinding realisation that he is, in fact, the real enemy; then switches sides - Evident in Shogun, TLS and Dances with Wolves. In any case, I patiently waited for the following month to end and my hype to be satisfied.<br /><br />So, armed with my ticket, a bucket of popcorn and an inexhaustable supply of cool drinks I sat down unprepared for what was about to arrive.<br /><br />For anyone even remotely educated with regards to Japanese culture this movie would be instantly labelled inaccurate and a misinterpretation of the Samurai warrior.  The movie is fraught with mistakes and a serious lack of understanding of what \'Honour\' actually meant to a Samurai. For God\'s sake, not even the seppuku scene is done properly!!!<br /><br />The acting, as with most Cruise movies, is about par, the only decent performance comming from Ken Watanabe for Katsumoto. The story is dry and lacks support, even with the special effecs, music and costume (Which are supprisingly good) it drags this movie, kicking and screaming, in to an adequeate 3 stars. The characters lack uniqueness and originality, making the movie a mission to watch, as they all follow the same predictable pattern. The genre is mixed, with no real consistency and tries dismally to blend it\'s bloodthirsty action/thriller nature with a more dramatic and historical theme.<br /><br />There is very little to credit this film and it provides itself as another mere supplement for my love of Japanese orientated movies, will there ever be one that is is comletely satisfactory? Kids may enjoy this movie, as will the more bored or ignorant adults - but any educated man will steer clear of giving this excuse for a movie any praise.'),(634,18,'B0001G6PZC','Dallas Buyers Club','The Moose Hole - Cruise\'s \'Last\' Oscar Stand','Warner Brothers can?t catch a decent break, can they? For the last three years, the studio has had a mixed year based on the performance and public reaction of their films with the missteps outshining the successes. 2003 continues that trend with the poor reception of films like Gods & Generals, Dreamcatcher, Alex & Emma, and Looney Tunes: Back in Action. But what makes this year all the more hurtful was the fact that studio was expected to have had a good year riding the Matrix sequels alone. After the mixed reaction Reloaded received in May, The Matrix Revolutions couldn?t compete like it was expected too and failed to even break the $170 million mark the original film set in 1999. So with those thoughts in mind, what good can Warner Brother executives find in this year? Oscar potential. The studio?s leading Oscar contender is Clint Eastwood?s Mystic River but recently The Last Samurai has emerged to be heading for Oscar gold as well. The film?s leading man, Tom Cruise, hopes this is true in order to redeem the failure of capturing a nomination last year with his role in the critically praise Minority Report. Whether Warner Brothers pushes more for this film or Eastwood?s picture depends on Samurai?s performance but what can be said is that this film will definitely be raising eye brows.<br /><br />The Last Samurai focuses on the journey of a man from the United States who is sent to Japan to help eradicate a rebellious force but learns more from his enemy then he ever imagined. Captain Woodrow Algren is no stranger to the field of battle. He has seen things that many can?t even imagine. Things that he would gladly like to forget if he could. In the time after the Civil War, Captain Algren takes to the bottle like many generals in the 1870?s America. With the Civil War now over, all that is left is the rebellious Indian tribes that have decreased in number rapidly and have been nearly suppressed. But the captain is surprised to be offered the position of training Japanese troops in destroying the last of the samurai warriors that have rebelled against the Emperor who has forced Western society on the nation of Japan. After he is captured by Katsumoto and his band of samurai warriors, Captain Algren learns that the rebel force is not as ?savage? as was once thought. Eventually he comes to find the true meaning of honor, necessity, and remembrance of where one comes from by joining Katsumoto in preserving the samurai way of life. The story of The Last Samurai has to be quite possibly one of the most thought provoking scripts of the year, even beyond the complex realm of the Matrix sequels earlier this year. The film successfully blends historical content from the post-Civil War events both in the United States and Japan with the exquisite traditions and philosophies of the ancient samurais. The Last Samurai is a positively rare sight in the modern age of big budgeted epic dramas that present dazzling special effects but fail to deliver insight into the human experience.<br /><br />Though only one member of the film?s cast can be easily recognizable to American movie-goers, it doesn?t really matter all that much as the level of true acting talent goes far beyond the means of one?s star-power. Tom Cruise gives in all honesty one of the best performances of his career, even more so then his critically acclaimed role in Steven Spielberg?s 2002 sci-fi drama, Minority Report. The amount of determination and vivid emotions Cruise brings to the role go far beyond the acting he has demonstrated in the past and showcases a true sense of maturity in the roles he has chosen and will choose in the future. Captain Woodrow Algren is a perfect presentation of the concept of the will to open one?s self to new culture and way of life despite all those who claim in can not be done. Ken Watanabe, who portrays the samurai lord Katsumoto, does a superb job with the material that is given to him and though some may note that he struggles with the English language presented in the script that is the point of the character. It?s a beautiful portrayal of a talented actor learning the language and the traditions of vastly different culture along the same lines as the character he plays in the film does. Though some may have complaints about the limited appearance Koyuki has as the widow wife Yaka, one must look beyond the amount of screen time her character has and concentrate rather on the substance of her material that does exist. Yaka?s conversation with Katsumoto in which she expresses disagreement over her care of Captain Algren demonstrates the prominent theme of the film, one of a battle raging between honoring the traditions of one?s ancestors yet at the same time maintaining a willingness to break free from those traditions and progress in the world.<br /><br />Overall, The Last Samurai is a rare theatrical treasure that not only successfully presents to the audience a well choreographed Bella-drama of breath taking action sequences and spectacular visuals but intellectuals statements that expresses the idea of expanding one?s mind to a world beyond their own realm. Despite containing an excessively long three hour time length, The Last Samurai does manage its time well although it is to say it does have its points where slow downs are less then warranted but these misgivings can be easily ignored. Many of the concepts that discussed within the framework of the film, namely necessity and ancestry, have already been presented in some degree in the two Matrix sequels earlier this year but Samurai manages to go beyond those films and express those same thoughts on far-less complex level. The way of the samurai is to stick to the traditions of their ancestors and not modernize the way their people have lived for hundreds, if not thousands, of years but as Katsumoto soon comes to realize, modernization, in one form or another, is inevitable in any society. Modernization can be integrated into an already existing culture but not to the extent that all traditions and practices once held by that society are lost forever. The intricate demonstration of certain philosophical practices within the film must be seen to be fully understood by anyone interested by the feature?s premise. The Last Samurai is without a doubt the best, if not the most surprising, film of the year, far exceeding even the extravagantly high expectations set by The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King. Though greatly overlooked at this year?s Academy Awards ceremony, those who witness this film?s brilliant achievements and take its message to heart will give this film a far greater honor then any Hollywood awards ceremony could ever give.'),(635,18,'B0001G6PZC','Dallas Buyers Club','The Last Samurai','Great battle scenes never seen in this scale.<br />Ken Watanabe and Tom Cruise was superb.'),(636,19,'B0001G6PZC','Dallas Buyers Club','Blu-Ray Review','I\'m gonna review the quality of the blu-ray version of this movie.

I\'m not a serious Cruise\'s fan, but I like his work and he works hard for his roles as many A-list actors do. Again, he should be nominated for best actor Oscar for his role in the Last Samurai. It has some of the modern themes of regional and global<br />superpowers dominations and attemp to change the inner cultures of other nations for the sake of self-centered interests and for the love of control. You\'ll find those elements somtimes hidden within the storytelling. The battle sequences are very well<br />performed yet they need to be longer in duration.

Many people say this is Dances With Wolves, yes the plot is slightly the same, but I watched Dances With Wolves, I have almost never watched such a boring movie, If The Last Samurai is this, it is certainly a much less boring version. And many people complain about how Tom Cruise doesnt die at the end, well \'It was not his time\' as Katsumoto explained numerous times in the movie. And the reason the children and Taka fall in love with Tom is that they forgave him for killing their father/husband, they beleived they where both warriors that did their duty on the field, and they certainly believed that their way of life was worth fighting for. I would think that the way of the samurai or Bushido was worth fighting for, especially back then.

This is Edward Zwick\'s crowning achievement and would be Tom Cruise\'s best performance if he hadn\'t been in \"Born on the 4th of July\". I enjoyed \"Master and Commander\" but it is so 2nd rate to this. This movie is a beautiful story about a civil war captain, scarred by the way he saw the Native Americans get salughtered by his fellow troops, who is brought by fate to these very spiritual people (the samurai), who learn him their customs and heal his psychological wounds. When his old American comrades come to bring down the samurai, he does all he can to defend them.It is similar to \"Dances with Wolves\" and \"Lawrence of Arabia\" in that it is about a depressed man who changes his ways. But I think that this movie is ultimately superior to them. (Another thing, the art and costume design in this movie are breathtaking, another reason to see this movie). This movie deserved the 10 oscar nominations \"Master & Commander\" recieved (including best picture).'),(642,25,'B0001G6PZC','Dallas Buyers Club','The movie was a perspective','For those who have always believed in being a Samurai, or trying to relive their days in the era that Samurai roamed, the movie in a way gave people that perspective. Of course, it\'s through the eyes of an American, because as we know it, Americans can\'t always see things clearly, only through hardships and experience of other people\'s culture can they truly come to know the differences and traditions of other nationalities. To me, I personally liked the movie for many reasons, the soundtrack was one of the many things, but it was the drama put into the story. It\'s like that old series, \"Shogun\", about a sailor from the west who was shipwrecked in Japan and brought up to become a Samurai. Stories that involve a learning process and finally understanding the ways of another is what I love to see in my movies, so I really do applaud the movie for what it does.'),(643,20,'B0001G6PZC','Dallas Buyers Club','The Last Samurai','The Last Samurai was certainly a surprisingly refreshing escape from the many senseless movies that\'ve recently been released into theatres. The movie was beautifully shot, paying close attention to detail, plus even the acting wasn\'t as dreadful as I\'d expected it to be. To add to everything, the writers even had the sense to put in little sequences of comic relief, whether you found it remotely funny or not... <p>I thought the casting was fantastically done. It was interesting to see Tom Cruise playing such a role. Though not the best actor in the movie, he certainly did good enough of a job in developing his character throughout the course of the film. Ken Watanabe was excellent as Katsumoto. Also, I found it rather....different...when I found out that the lead actress, Koyuki, was 28 years old! Given the fact that so many \"young\" actresses are casted in movies these days (unless they are the starring role), I just found that fact interesting... <p>Another good thing about this movie is that the Japanese characters actually speak Japanese to one another (there are subtitles, of course). There are numerous American films out there where peoples of different ethnicities end up speaking English to one another in the films, as opposed to their ethnic languages. This film, however, failed to follow that trend, which in my eyes made the entire atmosphere of the film much more authentic. Instead of the Japanese peoples speaking English to one another, the foreigner is forced to learn and adapt to the language of the Japanese instead. <p>Of course, this movie wasn\'t always perfectly unscathed. Given that it\'s an American film, you just had to expect its few \"Hollywood\" moments. It\'s odd how Tom Cruise is able to defend himself from a gruop of samurais in the opening battle, and later degrades himself to a nobody when he fights against Katsumoto for the first time. Then there are the moments when everyone dies in a scene expect, you guessed it, good ol\' Tom Cruise. Oh well, what\'s a Hollywood movie without these moments? <p>Overall, I\'d highly recomment this movie. Unless you absolutely cannot stand the mere sight or thought of Tom Cruise, I\'m quite confident that most audiences will enjoy this movie'),(644,21,'B0001G6PZC','Dallas Buyers Club','My 2nd Favorite Movie','I saw this movie on the 28th of December.  I walked out of the theater very, very, very satisfied with the movie.  The audience was the worst audience I\'ve ever sat through a movie with it.  If the audience is bad, it can ruin the movie, and make you like it half as much.  That\'s probably why it\'s only my second favorite movie.  (My favorite being Office Space)  Though this movie is rated R, it really isn\'t that bad.  There is blood, but no gore.  When someone gets stabbed, naturally, they\'re going to bleed.  When somone gets shot, naturally, they\'re going to bleed.  But, they\'re flesh isn\'t naturally going to be split apart.  This movie keeps it realistic.  To tell you what it\'s about: it\'s about an ex-civil war captain.  He goes to Japan to teach the Japanese soldiers American tactics.  In their first battle they aren\'t ready and get defeated.  The captain gets captured and taken to a place with many Samurai.  At first, he\'s their enemy. He then learns the way of the Samurai, and befriends the Samurai.  To tell you anymore would be to ruin the movie.  But I can tell you this much: go see this movie- you won\'t regret it.'),(654,22,'B0001G6PZC','Dallas Buyers Club','Hollywood\'s flawed imitation of Kurosawa.','For many western viewers, this may be the first \"samurai\" film that they have watched with only a vague and rudiamentary knowledge of who the samurai were, what they symbolized, and how they arose and declined in power.  The more one knows about the samurai, the more \"phoney\" this film appears to be.  Make no mistake, this film is more about samurai ideals rather than the actual samurai.  This film romanticizes the samurai warrior class when many people understand the samurai as nothing more than a bunch of sword-wielding bullies who enforced the will of the local warlord or Daimyo.  There\'s an early scene in the movie \"SHOGUN\" where a samurai instantly sliced off the head of a peasant who simply did not bow in the presence of a samurai.  I watched Kurosawa\'s \"RAN\" (before watching \"THE LAST SAMURAI\" in the cinema) where the samurai are portrayed as self-destructive powermongers.  \"THE LAST SAMURAI\" looks good visually, but its potential as a great film is compromised by Tom Cruise\'s egotism and Hollywood\'s cliches and obligatory plot devices (such as the weak \"happy\" ending).  Nonetheless, this film is a good introduction to the CONCEPT of the samurai to anyone who knows little about this complex warrior elite that have come to symbolize the old agrarian Japan that is now seemingly lost in today\'s technocratic Japan.<br /><br />By the way, Japan\'s new modern army was modelled along Prussian lines.  The sight of American officers training Japanese soldiers wearing Prussian-looking uniforms continues to leave me baffled.  On the other hand, it\'s a Hollywood film where it is too commercially risky to cast Tom Cruise as a German officer named \"Fritz\" who drowns his sorrows in shnapps instead of whisky.'),(655,23,'B0001G6PZC','Dallas Buyers Club','The Samurai Kid','The Last Samurai is a breathtaking, historical, panorama that examines the blending of cultures and the clash of competing value systems. In this film, Tom Cruise plays Nathan Algren a twelve year old boy who has moved from New Jersey to the California Coast with his single mom. While adjusting to his new environment, Algren practices Bushido (the way of the warrior) from an instruction book and from a few introductory classes that he learned at the local YMCA in his hometown. <p>He also befriends a local girl who, unfortunately is hounded by her ex-boyfriend, an arrogant and aggressive teenager who cruises around town with his friend on dirt bikes. When the ex-boyfriend catches Algren and the girl together a fight ensues and Algren is beaten and humiliated. This prompts Algren to go to the local Bushido dojo where unfortunately he discovers that the ex-boyfriend is the star pupil and the instructor is a sadist. <p>Fortunately, Algren meets Mr. Miyagi an old Samurai warrior who works as a handyman in Algren\'s rental unit. When Mr. Miyagi realizes Algren\'s dilemma he takes him on as his lone pupil and teaches him the way of Bushido. Mr. Miyagi orders Algren to paint his fence, wax his car, and strike girlie-man poses on a post by the sea shore all the while promising that this will teach him how to wield a Katana like no other Caucasian man has ever done before.<p>And somehow it works. All of Mr. Miyagi\'s household chores turn out to be magic Samurai conditioning techniques that convert Algren into the Unstoppable White Warrior (UWW). From here an epic battle takes place between Algren and the ex boyfriend and his evil cohorts. I won\'t give away the outcome of this incredible battle scene except to say that Cruise does a lot of grunting, his eyes puff out during some of the more visceral moments of combat and his beard flutters in the wind like the calm of the butterfly.'),(656,24,'B0001G6PZC','Dallas Buyers Club','My Favortite movie by far','Way better than Lord of the Rings.

It\'s one of my daughter\'s favorites and was under the Christmas tree for her this year.<br /><br />Tom Cruise is the star.  He plays Nathan Algren, a veteran of wars with the American Indians and is haunted by atrocities committed.  We see numerous black and white flashbacks of women and children being shot by soldiers.  Being part Native American, I found these sequences particularly moving and disturbing.  So for me, Algren\'s depression that sent him to drink seemed quite believable.  Cruise does seem so determined that his acting at times seems a bit forced and calculated rather than an organic performance.  That said, he was nominated for Best Actor by the Golden Globes.<br /><br />Edward Zwick directed the picture and won the Best Director Award from the National Board of Review.  He has also directed \"Glory,\" \"The Siege,\" & \"Blood Diamond.\"<br /><br />Ken Watanabe as Katsumoto shined in this picture.  He\'s the philosophic Samurai who leads the rebellion against technological compromises with the West.  He demonstrates intelligence, compassion and the rarest of all screen commodities, wisdom.  The final battle sequence is incredible.  He well deserved his Best Supporting Actor Oscar nomination.  Tim Robbins took home the gold in that category for <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001ZX0OW\">Mystic River (Widescreen Edition)</a>.<br /><br />Tony Goldwyn who is the grandson of movie mogul Samuel Goldwyn (think MGM) plays the role of Col. Benjamin Bagley.  Goldwyn is still most associated as the bad guy in \"Ghost,\" and plays an arrogant soldier who despite his good looks is not sympathetic.<br /><br />Hiroyuki Sanada plays Ujio, the apparent second in command to Katsumoto.  Sanada has been nominated for five Best Actor awards from the Japanese Academy with two wins including one for his brilliant portrayal in <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00065GX0K\">The Twilight Samurai</a>.  He does an excellent job taking an instant dislike to Algren, battling him into the mud in a rainy day duel, and eventually coming to respect him after Nathan battles against the masked Ninja who attack their village.<br /><br />Smaller roles deserving of special mention are Koyuki\'s performance as Taka, who nurses Algren to health despite complaining that he smells like a pig.  She was in the Japanese film \"Pulse.\"  Shichinosuke Nakamura plays the uncertain Emperor Meiji.  Sosuke Ikematsu does a delightful job as the young boy Higen who tries to be tough like a Samurai, but can shed a tear.  Director Masato Harada makes an acting appearance as Omura who wants to bring railroads and Western weapons to Japan.  Shin Koyamada is a good looking young actor.  He plays Nobutada who takes a number of arrows on his escape on the bridge and brings humor and determination to his screentime.  Billy Connolly who was Uncle Monty in \"Lemony Snicket\" plays the gray-haired Zebulon Grant who stands by Algren and suffers a fatal wound in the first battle.  Zwick does a nice job of creating a good ensemble with his cast.<br /><br />In addition to Watanabe\'s nomination, this film was also nominated for Oscars for Best Sound Mixing, Best Art Direction and Best Costume Design.  The Japanese Academy awarded it as \"Best Foreign Film.\"  As a piece of fictional cinema, it is a tale well told.  Enjoy!'),(658,18,'B0001G6PZC','Dallas Buyers Club','Good story, Good action.

The sword fights are wonderful, especially one where Tom\'s character is set upon by four samurai.  Usually, a Hollywood film showing the hero fighting against multiple attackers looks extremely corny: with each one waiting his turn to charge.  This one looked quite a bit more compelling.

He is hired to train the &quot;modern&quot; Japanese army in defense of Samurai warriors who persist in rebelling against modernization of the Japanese culture.

He learns to respect the Samurai as he lives among them and learns their ways.  They return him to his people, but he begins to see that nobility lies with the Samurai and not with those who are trying to modernize Japan.  It is all quite simplistic and the characters are pretty much stereotyped.  There are lots of battle scenes, but never does this movie touch the emotions of the viewer.  There are tears shed, but they are all shed by the actors and not the viewers.  This is an epic film which fails to be a great one.'),(670,27,'B0001G6PZC','Dallas Buyers Club','A cinematic but flawed epic....','A movie with production value like The Last Samurai will never go unnoticed. Especially when it boasts some of the most recognizable names in Hollywood. But whether the movie holds good on its own or not is an altogether different issue.That job is left to us, the viewers. And The Last Samurai, albeit with some reservation, does manage to stand on its own against the likes of Dances With Wolves and Glory.<p>The Story:<br />  The Last Samurai is about the cultural and industrial revolution Japan goes through in the late 19th century, forcing some of its most ancient institutions to crumble under the onslaught of western modernization. Meiji (Schichinosuke Nakamura), the young but rather hasty Emperor of Japan is determined to see his country stand against other industrialized nations and believes this can only happen by forgoeing the traditions that Japan held dear for nearly 2000 yrs.<br />  The first to be sidelined is the very force that was created by erstwhile Emperors and clan chiefs to protect them and Japan. The warrior swordsmen called Samurai. The Samurai (or \'to serve\') is in itself a community that adheres to certain strict moral standards of living which it neither changes nor bends. The Samurai are known for their extraordinary loyalty , honour and fighting skill and there traditional sword, the \'Katana\', is considered to be the finest sword in the world. <p> The sudden change in Japan appalls the Samurai, and it is provocation enough to make them turn against there own master. Their leader Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe) believes this resistance to be in the service of the Emperor himself; to make him understand how much the Samurai sacrificed for him and his like and for what values it stands for. However the Emperor, influenced by his coterie of corrupt officials, is unrelenting. He needs a credible force to defeat the Samurai once and for all.<br />In comes the American connection...<p> To support and aid the modernization of the Japanese Army, Captain Nathan Algren(Tom Cruise), a guilt-ridden, alcoholic Civil War veteran is recruited by his<br />his cold, ruthless and remorseless superior Colonel Bagley (Tony Goldwyn). Landing in Japan only to find himself leading an untrained battalion of \'conscript\' farmers with guns, the first battle with the enigmatic Samurai ends in total disaster, with Algren being the only man left behind. Injured and semi-conscious, Algren is held captive by the Samurai until he is fully healed. It is during this period that Algren slowly comes to respect his enemy and learns their way of life. And the community in return learns to admire his transformation.<br />Slowly but surely, Algren understands the plight of the Samurai and joins their cause, culminating in an epic battle between modernity and honour. Swordsman vs Rifleman. The Archer vs Howitzers.<p>The movie:<br />There is no doubt the real strength of the movie lies in lack of any flashy effects. Zwick does well to cover even the final battle in the classic war mold without relying too much on the numbers as against realism. The settings are lavish and completely authentic. The costume design is flawless. Though the movie\'s story does not do justice to the factual events of Japan\'s history, it is nonetheless interesting. The cinematography is beautiful and the music by Hans Zimmer is exemplary, wonderfully theme oriented. The overall production value will no doubt, keep this movie in the limelight for quite a few years to come.<p>The cast:<br />This movie was supposed to showcase Cruise\'s acting talent,but it ended up being a Japanese delight. Ken Watanabe should have won the Supporting Actor Award (I\'m not taking anything away from Tim Robbins though). He was really compelling, dignified and totally original. Shin Koyamada (Nobutada), Sosuke Ikematsu (Higen) as his sons are superb. However the real star of the movie is the newcomer Koyuki(Taka) as the sister of Katsumoto. She brings a rare and beautiful screen presence to the movie, not to mention her silent but wonderfully conveyed feelings towards Algren. And she is downright beautiful. The rest of the cast including Timothy Spall(Simon Graham), Tony Goldwyn(Col.Bagley), Emperor(Nakamura)and Masato Harado(Omura) does its job commendably.<p>The downside:<p>If ever there was any reason for this movie to be a disappointment (which it commercially was, as far as epics go), it would have to be the main protagonist himself. Though Tom Cruise is a great actor, here he is steriotypical and unconvincing.Totally predictable. Part,if not most of this fault lies with director Edward Zwick too. Zwick never really showed how Algren changes when held captive by the Samurai, the most important period of the movie. Not only that, the ending was totally cliched as Algren is left the last man standing (and always an American at that!). Hence the title of the movie becomes even more ambiguous. And this only stifles Cruise\'s performance and lowers his character from being a champion to a \'has been\'. I personally feel Zwick should have invested some more time on Cruise\'s period of transformation.<br />And oh before I forget,if you have watched Dances with Wolves, you will say that The Last Samurai is a product of pure plaigiarism. And it\'s true. You just cannot watch this movie without recalling the Dances With Wolves\' theme with almost exacting detail. Just the setting is different. On a face-to-face basis, TLS will not beat the true originality of DwW. That is for sure.Unfortuantely the Producer and the Director themselves were resposible for this movie to reach the level of \'a good..\'instead of \'a masterpiece...\'.<p>Conclusion:<br />Luckily the movie does stand on its own. This has to do with the individual themes in the movie than as a whole. See it for the Samurai. Their way of life and honour is extremely interesting and educative. You would wonder how such a thriving culture was virtually wiped out in less than 10 yrs. The cinematography and music are the movie\'s other assets. The main battle scene is utterly realistic and in the end, poignant.At over 21/2 hrs, the movie has a laid back feel to it that will ultimately give you your money\'s worth. Definitely go watch it.'),(671,28,'B0001G6PZC','Dallas Buyers Club','The Japanese Spirit','As a Japanese person, I watched this movie with much skepticism. I expected many stereotypes etc.<p>I was pleasantly surprised.<p>I thought it was an intesting twist how it took a &quot;outsider&quot; to convince the young emperor to make the stand he made at the end. Even Katsumoto wasn\'t able to do that. I think the emperor was reminded of the Samurai Spirit, ironically by a Westerner.<p>The scene near the end, with the new machine guns from America, depicts with new beginning of modern Japan. It was sad to see how easily the Samurai was defeated. 1 by 1 like bowling pins, these greate warriors went down. It\'s as though they saved the &quot;best&quot; for last. So to me, those machine guns symbolized the modernization.<p>I thought Katsumoto\'s character was great but thought Cruise\'s character was needed to complete the story.<p>The &quot;Seppuku&quot;, or suicide, is not an act of cowardice. It is an act of honor. It was considered the honorable way to die. It depicts the deepest dedication of the Samurai. You see this in the modern world today. Maybe not to this type of extreme. Sacrifice oneself for the love of country isn\'t so far fetched an idea.<p>I think this world could use a little bid of that code of honor...'),(672,28,'B0001G6PZC','Dallas Buyers Club','If You Loved Dances With Wolves and Braveheart...','What a wonderful movie! In the same tradition as Dances With Wolves and Braveheart, this historical epic really showed me a world of amazing bravery and a beautiful culture that has found itself dying out.<p>The story is a classic hero\'s journey of a man haunted by deeds of his past, who finds unexpected redemption through his involvement with a people whom he at first sets out to destroy. Nathan Algren leaves behind his nightmares of his time spent in the American west to take a position in Japan, training the new Imperial Army to fight the ancient samurai who are rebelling against the government\'s efforts to modernize. Taken prisoner by the samurai leader, Katsumoto, he develops a bond with the great warrior and a respect and love for both the Japanese people and the samurai way of life. Adopting their ways as his own, eventually he finds a way to forgive himself for the atrocities he\'d committed in his past and to find the honor he feels he doesn\'t deserve.<p>The settings in the movie are beautiful, depicting a bucolic and serene Japanese countryside steeped in mystery and tradition. Yet underneath it all lies the teeming violence inherent in the samurai way of life. Never for once are we allowed to forget that these men are trained warriors. Even in a moment of fun and celebration they are called upon to defend their people against cloaked assassins. <p>I admit that the \"Tom Cruise\" factor was a bit of a distraction for me. I was never quite able to forget that it was Tom Cruise on the screen, and perhaps if the movie had starred an actor with a lesser well-known resume, I might have been able to lose myself more in the mind of the hero. Still, Mr. Cruise did a wonderful job of showing the inner demons of Nathan Algren and the subsequent transformation that took him from a disillusioned Civil War hero to an honorary samurai warrior willing to lay down his life for a people and a way of life not his own but still worth saving.<p>I also loved Ken Watanabe, who demonstrated the quiet strength, wisdom and bravery that would have made his character, Katsumoto, a legend among both samurai and the Japanese people.<p>The only complaint I have is that I would have loved to see the relationship between Nathan and his caretaker, the beautiful Koyuki as Taka, developed. As it was, the love that grew between these two was shown in long gazes and even, eventually, an almost chaste kiss and a few lingering touches. Perhaps it is simply the romantic in me that would have loved to have seen more.<p>For a great story, this movie really fits the bill. Action, intrigue, a tortured hero and a subtle love story - between an American and the samurai culture - are all blended together to make for a wonderful experience.'),(673,29,'B0001G6PZC','Dallas Buyers Club','The Last Samurai = A Masterpiece','Tom Cruise is a famous actor worldwide. Most of you have seen his work in various films, such as A Few Good Men or Jerry Maguire. However, Tom is back in a new movie, which takes the audience back into an era of the past - one that surrounds us in the days of the Civil War. Tom Cruise portrays a man named Nathan Algren, who is a hero during the Civil War, but is disillusioned of the terrible killings he had to perform under the leadership of Colonel Bagloney against the American Indians. He is hired, by the Japanese Emperor, to take down another rebellion by leading a army of Japanese peasants that never saw a gun in their life. Even though he trains them for a time, the rebels attack and Algren is ordered to track them down and defeat the adversary, despite the fact that more training is needed. <p>Fighting somewhere in the forests of Japan, his army is easily defeated and the rebels capture him and take him back to their village. Becoming a captive and not having a chance to escape, due to the fact that winter\'s coming, Algren spends his time with these people, already inspired and intrigued. He comes to learn that these people are \"Samurai\", who serve the Emperor and follow life through a different path and a set of principles that keep their life in balance, using such values as loyalty, duty, and compassion, just to name a few. Only one problem remains - Japan is facing a new modernized world and is seeking to keep up with the times by throwing away the traditions of old in favor of a more-friendly government. The rebellion, lead by a samurai named Katsumoto (portrayed by Ken Watanbe), despies that idea and fight back in order to keep their sacred ways alive. Gaining his sense of honor and redemption back, Algren joins the Samurai and aids them in a fierce battle that decides Japan\'s history for the rest of time. <p>The movie does have its dose of action scenes and story moments, but what really make this movie unique are its philosophical moments. The Samurai, as you know, are people that follow the way of the Bushido, the traditional code of the Japanese samurai, stressing honor, self-discipline, bravery, and simple living. It\'s the type of values that most people wish to live by, but the Samurai go far beyond that. If they are defeated in battle, then it means that they have dishonored themselves and their clan, thus will kill them for disgracing their families and those close to him or her. It\'s a tough life, to be sure, but it\'s the principles of their life that stands out. Tom Cruise said it best about the Samurai: \"They are an intriguing people. From the moment they wake, they devote themselves to the perfection of whatever they pursue. I have never seen such strong discipline.\"<p>In order for the movie to display any realism, the movie was shot around various locations in Japan, from a temple located in Kyoto to a small Japanese town called Himeji. Not only the locations needed to be authentic, but also so did everything else, as this movie took place in two different worlds. Everything had to blend in for the movie a sense of honesty into the whole project. Though there is some historical inconsistencies in the plot, since this is based on a certain era in the past, those can be looked past. <p>The action is wild, but again, had to be realistic. So realistic, in fact, that there was some close calls on the set. Tom Cruise could have died, since an actor\'s sword nearly beheaded him. That\'s just one example, but just by checking out the loads of extras on the DVDs, the entire team was committed to the project, making sure that everything went smooth and made the picture look good as a whole. The fighting sequences also add some depth and insight as to how the Japanese and Americans deal with combat, especially in the climatic battle that had both samurai and soldier confronting each other in the end. <p>Overall, The Last Samurai is worth checking out, especially if you are a student of Japanese history or if you\'re into everything or anything Japanese. It\'s also some of Tom Cruise\'s best work by far.

Tom Cruise delivers his most convincing role to date and this is one of the few parts I actually liked him in (thats saying a lot!). Of course, as mentioned in numerous reviews, Ken Watanabe steals the show as the Samurai leader and should have been awarded the Oscar over Tim Robbins. The action scenes are brutal and hold your interest, (SPOILERS!!!) but I didn\'t like the fact that Cruise was the only character to survive the final battle. Very unrealistic and is truly the only part that brings the film down a bit. Great cinematography and an excellent soundtrack as well.

Okay! It\'s not Kurosawa! It\'s not some fantastic hard to locate Samurai classic! It\'s not worth taking your hand out of your laps and getting out of your mom\'s basement long enough to go and purchase it!!! However, Mr. or Mrs. Purist, it certainly serves as a decent introduction into the Samurai film genre!!! Before I go any further, here\'s the lowdown:<br /><br />Story- It really is \"Dances with Wolves\" with Samurai! Admittedly, it also reeked (in essence) of Mel Gibson\'s \"Braveheart\" and \"The Patriot\"!! Shogun lite??!! Nevertheless, it still was a good film despite a lack of originality and the usual \"clich&eacute;\'s\" of honor, loyalty, integrity and love. Noticed that I said that it was a GOOD film Mr. and Mrs. Purists, not a great one!!! Its good family fare and I hope will provoke interest in some of the other Samurai films (which usually are poor family fare). In all fairness, it should be stated that the purists are right in the fact that it\'s not exactly historically accurate and a little more research and a better script would have helped out a lot! <p>One issue I would like to address is this racist notion that a \"white guy\" running around playing Samurai is a \"bad\" thing. Admittedly, it\'s not exactly historically kosher but it isn\'t necessarily a horrible thing. Nevertheless, playing pin the label on the \"white guy\" isn\'t exactly kosher either! <p>Action- The action sequences are tightly and neatly done. The Samurai fan in me wanted more!!!  I would point out that I did think it a little over the top for Tom Cruise\'s character to become such a astoundingly formidable Samurai in such a short period of time! It did kind of remind me of the old Tom &amp; Jerry cartoon skits where Tom learns how to \"Play the piano in three easy lessons!\" and just after hitting three keys he then rips into Chopin!!! Despite this, the fights were still entertaining, just far and few between! Parents should be warned that there is some blood involved but not on the level of \"Barveheart\".<p>Acting- This is where the good and the bad comes in. The good was the attractive performance Wantanabe gives. He appears to be enjoying the role and that is always infectious! Hey, Hollywood! Here\'s the guy for an updated version of \"Shogun\"! Then, there is Tom. Tom! Tom! Tom! It\'s not that he\'s bad in this, he really is not. However, he really didn\'t fit the role. Most folks won\'t care and that\'s not a bad thing but Tom is certainly not Samurai! I couldn\'t say who would be but I know for certain that it isn\'t him! The problem really lies at the feet of his celebrity. He\'s just too well known. Every time he stepped into a scene, his being TOM CRUISE detracted from the moment and his decent performance. I would have to say that a more gruffly someone (the beard didn\'t sell Tom!) of less renown or an up and comer would have benefited the role a little better. This would have also placed more visual emphasis on a scene as a whole and prevented any celebrity distraction. Yes, Tom! You CAN be too popular for a film\'s good!!!! Nice try though! <p>The other actors gave us fine to solid performances but I\'m sure that plenty of other Samurai lovin\' \"Amazonians\" will try and learn us different. <p>DVD Quality- Issssss goooood!!! Why on earth anyone would want the full-screen version of such a film is totally beyond me??!!!! Death to full screen!!! Trust me; it\'s for your own good!! <p>Extras- The extras are fairly generous. I know that there will be those who will have demanded more but what more could they really want? I never quite understood the desire in demanding that every film have 4-6 hours of extras. I guess these folks have too much time on their hand (I know what I said)!! I would like to point out that the Hollywood vs. History was a slight let down. Instead of expert analysis, we got a fairly informative and slightly inaccurate historical overview on Samurai history. It would have been nicer to see a discussion between a panel of dusty old scholars rather than the movie promo we get. The rest of the extras are informative if a little on the short side. <p>In closing, Last Samurai is good but not a masterpiece but then it\'s not the master-piece of ca-ca as the purists would have you thinking. It not without it\'s faults but only after one devours a few of the films listed below will one begin to see what those faults are.<p>Next!!- Now then, where to go from here.

Still, I think the fans of Tom Cruise and the modern Hollywood presentation would have seen this as more of an overwhelming hit than I did, as I plunked down for 150 minutes of what was, after all, the fabled silver screen that had so entertained me as a kid in the 1970s.  What it looked like, more than anything else, was a new entry in the style of shoot-em-up (or slice-em-up) Western movies, as indeed the time setting would make it, at 1876 - 1877.  Cpt. Algren, late of Custer\'s fame in the post-bellum Indian campaigns, is off to assist the nascently forward-looking empire of Japan, who seems to be having its own trouble with stubborn indigenous folk.  In taking a newly-formed conscript army to the field against the nobly-savage Samurai (are these the same \"Samurai\" I remember there being seven of?), he comes face-to-face with who they really are, under the care of the gracious Taka (Koyuki), who bids him to carry on the tradition of her family\'s honor, using his \"mind\".  Don\'t worry, the \"mushy\" parts aren\'t all that frequent, as in the typical John Wayne or James Stewart classic, so the younger boys won\'t have to keep their eyes shut long.  I was indeed struck by the immense quality of the cinematography, on what appeared to be a 2.35:1 aspect screen, and the action buffs will be thrilled by all of the assorted combat, both hand-to-hand and (one-sidedly) firearms-related.  Students of Japanese will approve of the dialogue (including by Cruise) in that language, though I had to keep my glasses fully on to read the subtitles.  My overall effect, upon walking back into reality, 127 years later, was one of feeling good.  This is what we earn our entertainment dollars (or Euros, Yen) to buy, and it was well worth it.

It\'s often compared with \"Dances With Wolves\" set in Japan, and indeed the plots are somewhat similar: Damaged American soldier livea among natives / foreingers, learns to embrace their way of life and stands up for their survival in battle. But that\'s where the similarities end. Of the two movies (both regarded as classics) I personally think Last Samurai is the vastly superior film.<br /><br />While it has been billed as an \"action\" film or a \"historical drama\" (both which accurately help describe the movie), The Last Samurai is first and foremost an Epic romance. Not to be mistaken as a romantic love story, the Epic romance is much larger in scope- a simple tale that beneath the surface is actually incredibly \"deep.\"<br /><br />First and foremost, the movie is a romance of ideals: friendship, honor, self discovery and self forgiveness, fighting for what you believe in, redemption...<br /><br />Detractors often argue the movie portrays capitalists and men of progress (such as Colonel Bagley and Omura) as villians who have no redeeming qualities. That is innacurate: YES, some characters who represent modernizaton are portayed as greedy and self serving (such as Omura); however, other modernists aren\'t villianized at all- General Hasegawa, the former samurai now fighting FOR the advancement of Japan, is certainly no villian- yet he is definitely modernist. The young nameless recruit who orders the machine guns to be fired at the end of the film is also not villianous. Even Tony Goldwin\'s Colonel Bagley isn\'t a greedy bastard like Omura- he truly believes that bringing American power to the less civilized nations of the world is the right thing to do. Today we might call such a person ignorant or prejudice, but back in the late 1800\'s when American globalization was still in its infancy, it was common for people to think the way Colonel Bagley did.<br /><br />The true villian in The Last Samurai is fear. Fear of stepping into the unknown- accepting and embracing the necessity of progress at the expense and abondonment of traditions held sacred and true; the fear in the millions of voiceless individuals who struggle and fall through the cracks of increasingly changing times; the fear of the individual man who has fallen so far from grace that he believes he is damned, beyond redemption and unable to find salvation.<br /><br />The true hero in the Last Samurai is the antithesis of fear, the romanticized ideals of hope, friendship, honor, self discovery and self forgiveness, fighting for what you believe in and redemption.<br /><br />Last Samurai covers a lot of ground in its 2 1/2 hour run time. The acting is amazing, the cinematography breathtaking, and the musical score beautiful. The movie is filled with individual scenes of incredible power that rank among the greatest ever put on film: for example, the scene where Taka dresses Algren for battle is an example of cinematic PERFECTION- not a word spoken, yet so much emotion conveyed. Or the ambiguity of Algren\'s fate at the very end of the movie , and whether or not the final scene of him returning to the village was real or just a figment of Simon Graham\'s (the narrator) imagination.<br /><br />Like any movie, The Last Samurai is going to have its detractors. It is also a film of immense power and beauty that I can watch any time.

Tom Cruise plays a drunken Civil War hero who hired by the Japanese government to modernize their army is captured by the Samurai rebels and falls in love with their doomed way of life.<br /><br />And what a life. Every shot of the Samurai village is postcard perfect almost to the point of unintended parody. Like Robert Redford\'s take on Montana in \"Legends of the Fall\", every view is spectacular, every sunset is orange, every leaf is colorful and falls just so and all the characters are freshly scrubbed and dressed in their Sunday best. You wouldn\'t be half surprised to see Hobbits pop out at any moment. Of course the old time Samurai are romanticized to the nth degree. Historically the Samurai at this point resembled Afghan warlords resisting a long overdue central government rather than the honorable colorfully armored knights that are depicted. (Samurai no more wore armor in the late 18th century than the British army did.)<br /><br />Yet the picture despite one or two faults works. The acting, with one exception is uniformly excellent. The battle scenes are plentiful and full of surprise and the pacing is good. On the dark side newcomer Nakamura Shichinosuke plays the Japanese emperor like he was channeling Michael Jackson. The voice and mannerisms of the gloved one is as out of place for a Japanese emperor than it would be for the Pope. His strangely self effacing dialogue doesn\'t help his cause, yet it truly is his performance that is cringe worthy. In addition the last scene is an awful Hollywood copout. I still recommend The Last Samurai highly however as a thinking mans action movie.'),(688,13,'B0001G6PZC','Dallas Buyers Club','I\'m Impressed....','I was very impressed with this movie. More so for the costuming and scenery than the acting. Although the characters were very good and the actors chosen to play the roles did fine jobs. As a semi-historical film, it glossed over many of the international politics that affected Japan in that era. But it did a fine job of depicting one result of those politics. Samurai of the \"old school\" saw their way of life slipping away, and being replaced by a style of warfare they felt was dishonorable. They also feared more foreign intervention in the coming years, and saw a gradual eroding of their Emporer\'s power.<br /><br />This is one of the few Tom Cruise movies that I felt he didn\'t try to carry the whole film. It achieved a fairly good balance of allowing the characters to all enjoy an importance in the film that made it more informative and enjoyable to watch.<br /><br />I was impressed with this film, and highly recommend it.'),(689,13,'B0001G6PZC','Dallas Buyers Club','Excellent Movie','Tom Cruise plays the role of Captain Nathan Algren, an American soldier who has become disillusioned with his life (he starts to regret the fact that the only thing he is good at seems to be killing). He reluctantly accepts a position to train an army of Japanese transcripts to use Western fighting techniques to combat the Samurai. He is ultimately captured by the Samurai, who need him as a source of information about their enemy.<p>As a captive of the Samurai, Nathan learns the ways of the Samurai and their people, and eventually learns to respect their philosophy about honor and service.'),(690,13,'B0001G6PZC','Dallas Buyers Club','Fuden no den - Transmitting the untransmittable','I\'m really not one to write movie reviews, I enjoy them for what they are and don\'t usually care enough to actually publish something about them.  However, for this film I will make an exception.<br /><br />First off, gorgeous scenary.  There is a scene with Tom Cruise practicing a sword kata with the sun setting in the background ... it\'s beautiful.  There are many wonderful scenes in the movie.<br /><br />Secondly, the plot is about transformation and self forgiveness.  I don\'t care if it\'s been \"done before\", this is a common archetype in all cultures and times and it is well portrayed through this film.  I find it well done, quite emotionally gripping at times.<br /><br />The action in this film is great, Star Wars eat your heart out.  I grew up in a traditional martial art family, and Tom Cruise did a very solid job with the sword play in this movie.  The star wars films drove me nuts, but maybe you don\'t need proper body mechanics when you have \"the force\".  Anyways, good work in the martial arena as well in this film.<br /><br />Finally, I saw this film three times in theatres and everytime people cried.  Seriously.  Everytime the end came around at least one person both men & women cried.<br /><br />Very well done film.'),(691,13,'B0001G6PZC','Dallas Buyers Club','Best Movie I Saw In 2003','The Last Samurai is a great movie, good story, very entertaining.  I\'d recommend seeing this movie as soon as it comes out on DVD if you haven\'t seen it yet.<p>This movie is not a study in phenomenology and existential philosophy, but a good movie that made tears come to my eyes and that doesn\'t happen too often.<p>I thought this movie was better than the Lord of the Rings, though I\'d guess that that comes from actually reading the books.'),(692,13,'B0001G6PZC','Dallas Buyers Club','Too small-scaled and unsophisticated compared with real samurai rebellions.','I\'ve been a fan of Ken Watanabe for long time. And, my grand-grand-grand father was a samurai lord of a tiny land in the northern Japan. So I was looking forward to see the movie and was dissapointed very much.<br /><br />First, amateurish battle scenes.<br /><br />When I heard Katsumoto\'s model was Takamori Saigo, I expected 60,000 samurai swarming along the mountain ridge or several  castles filled with cannons and guns, and a series of cunning battle tactics in Sun Tzu style - that was what happened in Saigo\'s last battle. Very suitable to a Hollywood spectacular.<br /><br />If Katsumoto was a commoner who imagined himself being a samurai like a Don Quixote, or a poor samurai without education in very far rural village, the story would be acceptable. But a trusted advisor of the emperor? No joke.<br /><br />Second, failures of exploiting full beauty in samurai culture.<br /><br />Usually, Ken Watanabe uses kimono very wisely to play a noble samurai role with a very elegant and dangerous atmosphere. In the TV series \"Zankuro\", Ken\'s role was an executioner and looked like a butterfly in fire. But in this movie, he couldn\'t show his talent because of very unnatural costume. He had to be in a 13th-century-style armor always (how foolish and tactless to fight in this muggy land). If the costume had been more realistic, the character of Katsumoto would be more complicated, sophisticated and attractive.<br /><br />In addition, the most profound scene was nearly ignored. It was the fan dance by Hiroyuki Sanada before the last battle. This traditional dance is an essence of Bushido. They performed it only when the death was unevitable in the coming battle, to express their unshakable faith. I don\'t understand why the scene ended in a blink.<br /><br />Finally, I\'d like to add the plus side. The sets of old Yokohama city was excellent. Even Japanese movie staff cannot create them so accurately and beautifully.<br /><br />In this movie, Hollywood proved they had capability to create a historical epic set in Japan.  I hope they wouldn\'t underestimate our history and culture any longer, and would show us a more breathtaking spectacular in the next movie.<br /><br />Well, I believe they can.'),(693,13,'B0001G6PZC','Dallas Buyers Club','First off...','I\'m actually surprised how anyone can bash this film, although when I came to this review section I quickly understood why. The bashers: one, someone who hates Samurai, and knows obviously NOTHING of Bushido! While the other who loves the term Gaikokujin, which is akin to foreigner for the none-Japanese literate, apparently this \"reviewer\" is upset and angry with his own bad luck with asian women and so decides to rant furiously against a great film. It\'s not a \"cliched notion\" as he calls it. Captain Nathan Algren not only nearly saved her life, but is symbolic to the Zen Way. He killed her husband, and symbolically takes his place as a way of keeping his honour and as a message of karma in the film.<p>Now, with those two mixed up reviewers tossed out of the mix, I wish to present to you an objective opinion.<p>The movie was great. I loved it. My favorite film ever, and I can saw that is alot coming from me, as I am a very cultured viewer. That is not to say you might not like it, as much of the film is in Japanese, and you would need to be open-minded to embrace it as I have. I personally, went in skeptically. I don\'t particularly like Tom Cruise\'s last performances. In specific, Mission Impossible 2, and all the other movies where it focuses solely on him. It\'s different in this movie. Tom Cruise contains his ego, and gives other people surprisingly proportionate roles. He was a hardened battle veteran, but still the movie shows that it was not his skill, as another reviewer whined about, that was great, but his perserverance. <p>I don\'t want to spoil the movie, so go watch it! It\'s my personal favorite ever, \"and that\'s saying a lot\" *quoting Samwise Gamgee* I loved Two Towers, watched it 3 days in a row before going to see this, and still this one tops it off. Purely magnificent. A work of art.'),(694,14,'B0001G6PZC','Dallas Buyers Club','The best film of the year!!!!!','This film is a must see!!!

I agree with the critics (something I rearely do...) when they say this film is of epic porportions.....  This film moved me very deeply, but it also had a touch of humor here and there..just enough. I can\'t wait until it\'s released so I can see it again!!!!'),(695,14,'B0001G6PZC','Dallas Buyers Club','The Last Samurai-Blu-ray','I have loved this movie since it was first released and have the original DVD release which I have watched several times.  Most all the reviews I see here are either for the Standard DVD and focus on the great story line and acting but not the quality of the DVD itself.  Yes, Tom Cruse does shows some wonderful acting chops and, yes, Ken Watanabe steals the show but let\'s move on.  So this one will focus on the Blu-ray DVD\'s quality.<br /><br /> Bought the Blu-ray version from Amazon and it was delivered post haste.  When I first looked at the back cover information I was disappointed that the audio was Dolby Digital 5.1 rather than a lossless DTSHD 5.1, almost thought of returning it before even watching but am glad I kept it.  The video quality of the movie is fairly pristine with no artifacting, good details in the shadows and a sparkling clear transfer.  While the audio quality is not the higher end DTSHD, never the less, the audio engineers did a fine job with the front and rear surrounds used subtly for action( actually, during the battle scenes, the rears deserved more discreet use of the rear channels) however, during the rainy scenes, of which there are many, the audio is evenly spread to all channels enveloping you in the rainstorm.<br /><br />The many extras on the single disc are from the 2004 standard release and there are only 2 deleted scenes that, to me, could have been included in an extended version.  I wish more extended deleted scenes had been included.  The supplied extras were all interesting and, as I said before, had seen them on the original release so nothing new on that front.<br /><br />Should you buy this on Blu-ray?  Yes, the video quality is definitely superior, however, not by that much.  The original release was pretty darn good. However, if you don\'t already have the Standard version, go for the Blu Ray.  I remain disappointed with the lossy audio but it still provides an excellent film.<br />Hopefully, this review has been of help and, if so, please check the \'Helpful\' button so I know I am on the correct path with my reviews for you. Thanks.'),(696,14,'B0001G6PZC','Dallas Buyers Club','Good movie','This is a pretty enjoyable movie with a good amount of Japanese history in it.

Overall a good historical film.'),(697,14,'B0001G6PZC','Dallas Buyers Club','A Favorite','This movie is one of my favorites very entertaining.

I have it on DVD, but the Blue-Ray is so much better.  All the action scenes look so real, almost like you are there.  Highly recommend.'),(699,15,'B0001G6PZC','Dallas Buyers Club','Tom Cruise\'s best.','The Last Samurai is an outstanding film that tells the fictional story of Captain Nathan Algren (Cruise), a soldier haunted by regrets hired to train raw Japanese recruits to fight the Samurai, and Samurai leader Katsumoto (Watanabe), who is leading a rebellion in Japan against those who he believes are westernizing the country too quickly. Algren ends up becoming a prisoner of the Samurai, but after spending a number of months as their captive, subsequently finds peace in their way of life. Eventually, he joins forces with the men he was hired to fight against.<br /><br />Not only is the plot interesting and original, but the performances of the actors are nothing short of amazing. Tom Cruise puts forth an outstanding effort, which I consider his best ever. Ken Watanabe is perfect as Katsumoto, commanding even more attention than Cruise, and all of the secondary characters are equally convincing in their roles. Some of the highlights include Koyuki as Taka, Hiroyuki Sanada as Ujio, and Timothy Spall as Simon Graham.<br /><br />The execution of the battle scenes was excellent. This can be attributed to a cast full of professional sword-fighters as extras and Cruise and Watanabe doing all their own stunts. As seen in the extras, the progression of Cruise\'s skills with a sword isn\'t staged, either. Sanada and others spent hours working with him every day until he could handle a blade with precision.<br /><br />Having seen this film a dozen times, I can also say I honestly am not able to find many mistakes in the filming and editing, either. The ones I have noticed are hidden well, and none of them take away from the film in any way. There are a few lines in the script that come across as slightly bland or predictable, but overall the script is very well written. Tom Cruise actually speaks Japanese in a handful of scenes, and he does it well.<br /><br />What really makes the movie, on top of everything else, is the beautiful score composed by Hans Zimmer. Though he often recycles his scores and changes them very little, this one is unique and powerful.<br /><br />The Last Samurai\'s historical accuracy isn\'t as poor as some reviewers would suggest, but it is a work of fiction. On the special edition of this DVD, 2 deleted scenes are included, along with \"the filming of\" one of the scenes, and \"the filming of\" the Cruise beheading scene. There is also a handful of interviews and a look at the real history of the decline of the Samurai in Japan.<br /><br />All in all, The Last Samurai is an extremely entertaining and convincing film. The special edition of this DVD is well worth the extra few dollars, and it has become one of my all time favorite movies.'),(700,21,'B0001G6PZC','Dallas Buyers Club','A True Masterpiece!','When I watch a movie that I enjoy, I\'ll watch it many times with months in between to allow it to breath. If I can find more depth and meaning each time, I consider it more than just a film, it becomes a teaching about life. Such is my finding for this exceptional movie. It offers up a wide variety of important, even vital, lessons of life portrayed to perfection by everyone involved. The writing, directing, acting, locations, depth of meaning are all most excellent! In today\'s world we often race by the more subtle and beautiful aspects of life. A movie such as this calls forth pause and consideration of what is being served up for our enlightenment as well as our enrichment. The Last Samurai is about the redemption of humanity as well as the individual- the awakening to a deeper level of life, honor, purpose, self sacrifice, and pure, love. While watching this film for perhaps the 7th time, I fully realized that it is a true masterpiece. I suggest to the viewer, that they treat this film as one would a rare and fine wine. The point is to take your time with this film, sipping it slowly and savoring every drop of it\'s wonderful bouquet of thoughts and emotions, and in the end become enriched by an understanding what films have the potential of delivering and sadly also, what they seldom do and that is a fuller appreciation of \"life in every breath.\"'),(701,26,'B0001G6PZC','Dallas Buyers Club','A very entertaining movie; a solid hit by Wantanabe and Cruise','This movie succeeds in its primary objective: it entertains.  There is a solid story here that engages the viewer, moves at a smart pace, and never drags.  Nor is this a shallow shoot-\'em-up.  There is a fascinating overarching theme here: the transformation of Japan into a modern, industrial nation and the fact that elements of Japanese society, i.e. the Samurai, will not easily fit into the new order of things.<br /><br />While this film has historical inaccuracies, it is a fact that there were revolts against the Meiji Restoration, which is what this film is about.  The Japanese are portrayed respectfully, and I think accurately, in this film.  The sets and scenery, by the way, in this film are about as good as you will ever find in any movie, and this one rewards the viewer who either sees it in a theater or on a first-class flat-screen TV (as I did.)<br /><br />Tom Cruise does a pretty good job in this film, and he has plainly matured as an actor over the years.  In my opinion, however, Ken Wantanabe, as the main Japanese protagonist, dominates every scene he was in, leaving the viewer wishing for more.  I have noticed this about Cruise (and other big-star) films--the director seems compelled to place Cruise in almost every scene.  Nothing against Cruise, but a little less would have been more, because the Japanese cast was engaging and competent, and I would have liked to have seen more of them.<br /><br />Overall an excellent film to which the viewer will return more than once.

I am totally in awe of the acting performances in THE LAST SAMURAI.  While I have never been a Tom Cruise fan (the publicity about him does not sway me one way or the other), this movie has given me a great appreciation of his talent.  It made me also realize what a tremendous amount of preparation work and physical training it takes for an actor to develop the skills for his roll.  Other performances in the movie were exceptional, especially that of Ken Watanabe.  If you have never seen THE LAST SAMURAI, don\'t have a clue what it is all about, or don\'t think its subject matter would interest you, take a chance.  If you don\'t want to buy it (the price is right), rent it.  After you have seen it, you will want to own it.  Don\'t like Tom Cruise?  Don\'t let that stop you.

I enjoyed the development of the relationship between Mr Cruise and Mr Watanabe\'s characters and by far Mr Watanabe was the better actor, a shame that his skill was not recognized.

He plays a Union soldier who slaughtered Native Americans and has flashbacks of the war with the Indians.<br /><br />Well, he\'s asked to go to Japan and help train Japnese soldiers to erase their history of the Samurai, and in again Tom Cruise is faced with the same situation as the weak Japanese military he\'s helping to create has a mission to wipe the Samurai at the request of the emperor.<br /><br />The story is simple.<br /><br />Tom Cruise goes to battle with the soldiers he has trained who haven\'t had really much training, kills a Samurai in battle, gets captured, is held hostage, and his captors treat him as a guest in their village.

He conquers his alcohol addiction and learns the way of the Samurai warrior.<br /><br />This tale is very touching because of the Zen way of life the Samurai have. He killed one of their own, and then is accepted as one of them and fights along side of them to prove themselves worthy of their honor.<br /><br />I still can\'t believe it was Tom Cruise in this movie, if only he could do more similar things to The Last Samurai.'),(708,16,'B0001G6PZC','Dallas Buyers Club','Great Action Flick','Terrific action-packed movie.

Such a mix of romance and honor, all beautifully blended together.  Tom Cruise does a WONDERFUL job in this film, playing a troubled man who took part in killing innocent indian tribes, who takes a job in Japan training japanese soldiers who would be trained to supress rebel forces led by Samurai Katsumoto, who believed that Japan was progressing into modern culturization too fast, and resisted political advisors that were urging the Emperor to do just that, become more western, and modern.  Katsumoto\'s tribe of Samurai defeat the  unit led by Capt Algren (Cruise) and capture him.  He is held in captivity with the Samurai, and thrives off the peace that is afforded him there.  He begins dwell in the same way he observes the people do in the village, and learns honor with the help of Katsumoto.  In the battle preceding his capture, Algren kills Samurai Horutoru,  Katsumoto\'s brother in law, and his caretaker Kata\'s husband.  During his time in this village, Kata is repulsed by Algren, troubled with the death of her husband.  As cruise learns the ways of these people, and japanese, he gives his formal apology to Kata, who surprises him by replying that he did his duty, and so did her husband, and that the apology was accepted.  As his status as a \'stray dog\' is gently brushed aside, he gradually becomes accepted.  When an assassin team of ninja attempt to kill Katsumoto, he refutes his american heritage and helps keep Katsumoto alive.  In the end, as a desperate attempt at saving the village in which Katsumoto\'s ancestors had worked so hard to build and protecet, Katsumoto and Algren lead an army of Samurai warriors against the rebuilt japanese army.  Witnessing this scene was so sad.  A doomed attempt.  Since Samurai refuse to bear firearms, they were vastly at a disadvantage, against the cannons and the new automatic turrets.  As a final test of honor, the remaining samurai charge the army, only to be vicously mowed down in the heat of battle.  In a final touching moment,  Algren and Katsumoto, wounded, Katsumoto perhaps fatally, contemplate Katsumoto\'s suicide in honor, only to end in the deed being done and Algren witnessing the utmost peace in death in honor.

My main concern walking into it was that the director would confuse the code of the samurai with western ideas about courage and honor, disregarding the more morbid side of the tradition to present some sentimental parable about discovering yourself or being good. In fact, though, the samurai ethos is treated with enough depth, the acting and pacing is excellent, and while there is some sentimental nonsense, it restrains itself more than most films do these days. The final battle is especially impressive - the choreography, the way that deaths of important characters are treated, and some of the images which arouse real pathos.<p>It\'s still nothing spectacular, though - it never really risks saying anything that hasn\'t been said before, or presenting some image which hasn\'t been seen before - but it\'s probably as good a movie as we could expect to be produced for a mass audience.'),(716,17,'B0001G6PZC','Dallas Buyers Club','All I can say is, WOW!','I was very impressed by this film.

But i would guess that it is because of him, this movie gained more attention among people and so typical americans can get the idea of what samurai really is and what they really think. <p>so overall i gave this movie 5 stars. I plan to go watch it again.'),(720,18,'B0001G6PZC','Dallas Buyers Club','The last samurai','This film has been compared (a lot) to Dances with Wolves due to the fact that they both share similar themes. A Civil War era soldier who finds himself thrown in the middle of a different culture and ends up embracing it and becoming part of it. <p>However, Edward Zwick\'s film differs from the Kevin Costner Oscar winner in that the principal character, Lt. Nathan Algren (Cruise) is down on his luck, having become a drunken caricature of his former self, deeply regretful of his actions, who accepts a job as an instructor for an incipient Japanese army that needs to be prepared to fight against the Samurai. <p>As he arrives to Tokyo he starts training a useless bunch of would-be soldiers who are sent to fight even if they\'re not ready for it. As a result, the newly formed army gets butchered by the battle experienced Samurai. During that battle, Algren fights bravely and kills one of the highest ranking warriors, getting the interest of the famed Katsumoto, the last great Samurai leader, who orders him captured and brought to his son\'s village as a prisoner. <p>Once there, Algren\'s life is changed forever as he gets to know the real lifestyle of the Samurai and their people. They turn out not to be the savages that the Japanese government makes them out to be. After spending winter with them, Algren \"changes sides\" and joins the Samurai in fighting the Emperor\'s army. <p>The title of the movie tells the final outcome. The Samurai lose the battle. Progress triumphs over tradition. New over old. But Algren\'s past demons are redeemed by his courageous actions helping the Samurai. <p>The true worth of this movie is its look. You can definetely see where the budget went (other than Cruise\'s salary). A whole village was built and the attention to detail is astonishing. The costumes are simply amazing, especially the battle armors. The costume designer is Ngila Dickson, who also worked in Peter Jackson\'s The Lord of the Rings trilogy. <p>Also of notice are the battle scenes, which are breathtaking. Very violent, but not gratuitous, they serve the story very well. <p>As for the acting, Cruise does a fine job, and is slowly but consistently becoming a better actor (even if this particular performance was not nominated for an Academy Award), but the movie belongs to Ken Watanabe (who was indeed nominated) as Katsumoto. His presence demands attention. He is the center of every scene he\'s in. Koyuki\'s performance as Taka, Katsumoto\'s sister and Algren\'s love interest, should also be noticed.'),(721,18,'B0001G6PZC','Dallas Buyers Club','Katsumoto is the King','It\'s 1876. Captain Nathan Algren (Tom Cruise) has been sent to Japan in order to help the Imperial Japanese Army become more \'modern\' and less \'traditional\' and ultimately prepare them to fight the legendary Samurai. Events occur that cause Tom Cruise to be a captive of the deadly but extremely polite Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe) who is the leader of the Japanese Samurai. At this point, the viewer begins to learn why the Samurai are fighting to preserve their way of life against Western influences and Cruise\'s character becomes emotionally bound to them and he integrates himself into their society after working hard to earn their trust. However, the film is not solely about the struggle for the Samurai to keep their way of life, another subplot includes the low key and shy love relationship between Algren and Taka, a quiet widow (played with subtlety by Koyuki). Though it isn\'t a big part in the film, it highlights the emotional aspect of the film and shows that this is not a film about swords. <p>Positive Points:<br />In my view, Cruise has been a decent actor with fluctuating performances but in this current effort, he has shown that he is improving and learning how to adapt to different styles of acting. He plays the tormented captain with surprising intelligence and conviction. I was very impressed to see him speaking Japanese - I loved the way this film mixed both English and Japanese toghether because it gave it a strong edge. However, The real star of this film is Ken Watanabe (Tom who?). He played Katsumoto with such a commanding and intense presence that it was hard to concentrate on Cruise or any other actor in the film. Without doubt deserves the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor. <p>Special mention should go to Koyuki and Ujio (played by Hiroyuki Sanada). As supporting roles, they both acted convincingly without saying much but succeeded in showing that there are many more interesting characters besides Algren and Katsumoto. <p>Great music score by Hans Zimmer and fantastic costume design that will not doubt trigger a trend in Samurai-influenced clothes. <p>Negative points: While the film was entertaining, it focused too much on Cruise. The supporting characters were great too and people like Taka and Ujio should have had more developed personalities. <p>What is Billy Connolly doing in this film? A Scottish man impersonating an Irish man?

The modernization of Japan serves as the underlying for the collision of differences between Nathan Algren (Tom Cruise) and Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe). Almost poetically and serenely does the movie converge these two characters as one is seeking his lost beliefs and the other is sustaining his honor from an ever-changing world. <p>The second act of \"The Last Samurai\" is the heart and soul of the movie as we marvel at the ways of the society from the sword training and disciplined lifestyle. All that is demolished by the third act. I admire the battle scenes and I do find it the source of the problem. Instead, the last scene was not necessary, it was inconsistent with the tone of the movie, and it went against everything the development of the movie. By having the modernized Japanese army kneel for the samurais and having the Emperor suddenly dismiss the arms agreement with the U.S. and becoming tearful for the samurais, it has sugarcoated the entire film. The film was about the honor carried by the samurais and how it is slowly diminishing beneath Western influences. Then all of a sudden, as if to make the audience feel a little bit better, director Edward Zwick decides to make a happy ending where all the samurais died victorious. We already know that the samurais are the heroes who died for a cause, but to have the Emperor suddenly feel apologetic makes him and the movie appear as feeble.

Walking out of theater, I realized that the movie actually worked.  <p>That\'s not to say it didn\'t have all the fundamental problems I was dreading.  Ninjas and assassins seem to come out of the woodwork so as to make sure the movie has the requisite number of &quot;Hollywood action-sequences.&quot;  The harsh conditions of late feudal Japan were overly-aestheticized (somehow both the mud the pesands dig in and the blood spurted by slaughtered Samurai seem higher and more beautiful than mere blood or mud).  And while many of the most beautiful cinematography of the movie seemed drawn directly from Akira Kurosawa\'s films, Kurosawa\'s ability to show the corruption that can exist even on the &quot;good&quot; side of a struggle was sadly lacking.  But despite its simplicity, there was not one moment during the &quot;epic&quot; length movie that I became bored.<p>And, in the end, that is where The Last Samurai shines.  The soundtrack, the cinematography, the surprisingly good acting and the relatively slow pacing somehow combine to present a quiet, breathtaking version of feudal Japan.  It may not make the most profound statements about the world (despite its philosophical overtones), but it does succeed in transporting the viewer into its own beautiful world.  And, for me, that beauty is well worth two or three hours of my time.'),(726,19,'B0001G6PZC','Dallas Buyers Club','Surprisingly Fine Movie!','THE LAST SAMURAI is for many of us a Sleeper of a movie.  The media mania was so high at the release time in the theaters that it seemed by the trailers that this was another massively expensive Epic riding on the Big Name Star vehicle.  Sadly, I avoided seeing this beautiful film on the big screen: now I wish I had not been so influenced by the hype.  THE LAST SAMURAI is at its core a very tender movie, a story of men overcoming their personal demons, of the power of allegiance to ideals, of forgiveness of the past and holding on to honor, of growth of the human spirit and soul.<p>1876, and America lands on the beautiful islands of Japan at the beckon of the Emperor to &quot;Westernize&quot; the country, and the army in particular, to stamp out the historical presence of the Samurai, a band of dedicated, gracefully trained warriors whose purpose was to defend the Emperor - a man believed to be the earthly manifestation of holiness.  The military men sent to perform this transformation are the guilt-ridden, alcoholic Civil War Captain Nathan Algren (Tom Cruise) and his commanding officer Colonel Bagley (Tony Goldwyn).  The two attempt to transform the inept army of the emperor\'s spokesman but when they encounter in battle the Samurai warriors and their leader Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe) they are naturally beaten.  Algren, through his native skills as a fighting man, is captured by the Samurai and is forced to live by their customs in the house of the wife Taka (Koyuki) of a man Algren had killed.  Most of the film is concerned with the gradual spiritual awakening of Algren, his commitment to the Samurai principles of battle and of life and Director Edward Zwick handles this quietly and with great dignity by exploring the growing bond among Algren, Katsumoto, and Taka.  The ultimate confrontational battle between the last of the Samurai and the newly Westernized troops of the Emperors\' advisors is not only epic in scale but also mythic in values.  <p>The entire cast is excellent and a large cast this is!  But the kudos that have been awarded Watanabe have for some reason not fallen to Cruise.  They are both excellent as are Tony Goldwyn, Koyuki, Timothy Spall, etc.  The cinematography is breathtakingly beautiful, the musical score is thoughtfully eloquent, and the BIG scenes are a spectacularly Grand as the intimate scenes are extraordinarily tender.

Japanese culture and history is dumbed-down for popular consumption.  Don\'t quite expect the realism we find in Kurosawa films here.  Like Dances with Wolves, this movie is painfully politically-correct.  I assume that the filmmakers were forced to proceed under the assumption that American audiences might not know what the Samurai - or indeed, the Japanese - are.  The unfortunate thing is that they are probably right.  <p>We stop at all the expected signposts along the way.  The Tom Cruise character forms a growing love for the foreign, yet honorable, ways of the Samurai.  We are treated to the pre-requisite attack by Ninjas.  Fortunately, there are plenty of swordfights, but the level of realism is about the same as in Kill Bill (I know something of Japanese fencings and exchanges - like in Kurosawa films - are brief and deadly).  <p>The film looks great.

At this time Japan is a nation undergoing remarkable change. The new Emperor has begun to modernize the formerly feudal nation at lightning speeds. Thus the stage is set in this oriental land for war between the old ways and the new ways. A rebellion of Sammuri warriors, who reject many of the new western ways has begun. The Japanese are at this time seeking advisors from all over the world to aid in thier modernization, including seeking military advisors from america to help train, update and lead the imperial army. An American Captain (Tom Cruise), a veteran of the indian wars, is hired towards this end - much thanks to the fact that he has experience fighting tribal leaders (the movie draws on the similarities between the sammuri and native american warriors). But Tom Cruise gets captured in the first encounter with the sammuri, and after living amongst these amazing people and learning thier ways, finds his own salvation in thier cause. <p>The plot isn\'t very complicated, but is rich in historical context and philisophical themes. All the charcters in the movies are very well done, and the acting in this film with only a few minor exceptions was absolutley fantastic (especially the portrayal of Katsomoto, which was just a brilliant performance).<p>The last sammuri has a little of everything. This is a movie that you will feel. You\'ll laugh, you\'ll be inspired, you\'ll be anxious, and you may even get a little watery eyed at some of the more tender moment. There\'s martial arts, humor, sword fighting, ninjas, battles, love, philosophy, drama - you name it. The movie has some great action sequences and battle scenes but these are not over-done - there is much more. The movie feels almost poetic at times, and the cinematogrophy is beautifully done.

Context-wise, the film hit it right oin the nose in terms of accuracy and really got it\'s points across all while being very entertaining.

But, to be bold, I declare that it is so in the context of the time and place. There is good and ill in every social framework, and unlike a Costner film that shall remain unnamed, Samurai doesn\'t preach such a dogma. <p>Instead, the film lifts you above it, and illustrates a fundamental truth of the human condition. It does not blunt us over by our shortsightedness; it enlightens us with the truth, and reminds us that we are susceptible to succumbing to inner demons of wealth, power, and accumulation. What matters most are not the tangible treasures that surround us, but the inner intangible treasures that define us. Our pleasure, our pain, our trials and struggles. Our victories...and our monumental failures. They establish who we are, and how we lived, and if at least one person remembers that, then we shall find life again. <p>Perhaps, in some small way, that\'s what this movie has done. While not entirely historically correct, and not without it\'s grandiose notions of good and evil evident in a traditional epic of scope, what The Last Samurai does is remind us of that greater truth, the greater potential inside each and every one of us.

During the early years of the American political and cultural incursion into Japan, Algren is hired essentially as a mercenary to train the Imperial Japanese Army in the ways of modern warfare.  Before he has had a chance to do his job properly, he is called upon to lead a well-equipped but poorly trained force against a \"rebel\" army led by the samurai lord Katsumoto (played by Ken Watanabe).  During the initial engagement, Algren\'s force is routed by the samurai and Algren himself is taken prisoner by Katsumoto for the purpose of \"understanding my enemy.\"<br /><br />Thus begins the gradual transformation of Algren from a highly stereotyped American chauvinist to a member of Katsumoto\'s community.  The early reception is cold and unaccepting, both by Katsumoto\'s family and his fellow samurai, but over time a grudging tolerance gives way to cautious familiarity and ultimately to full acceptance and respect.  As I observed this process, I could not help being reminded of \"Dances With Wolves\", in which Kevin Costner\'s character undergoes a similar rebirth.  This notion was fueled even more by the romantic energy between Algren and the widow of a samurai whom he had killed during his capture.<br /><br />Algren eventually rises to enjoy great respect and admiration among Katsumoto\'s people, becoming in effect the samurai lord\'s right-hand man and deputy commander.  He helps lead Katsumoto\'s forces in several battles against the Japanese army, including the climactic final engagement where his honor is put to the ultimate test (but I won\'t spoil the ending for those who haven\'t seen it yet).<br /><br />Overall, I found this to be a very enjoyable and moving tale of the clash of cultures, somewhat loose in its historicity, with a strong emphasis on concepts like valor, honor and independence.

When captured by the enemy, the American is asked to stick around for \"conversations\" with the leader of the samurai, who in turn, teaches the Yank a thing or two about life.<br />The film is brilliant in that way because it allows us to connect our own tainted dreams, hopes and ambitions to Cruise\'s journey through the higher mindedness of the Samurai.<br />talk about an amazing transformation and outlook on life. I always believed that much of that Zen stuff was just plain double-talk, but this film is amazing in both its depth of character interaction and preciseness of dialogue, through which great thought and resonance is placed upon every scene, every word and every action sequence. To that end, consider how almost every person who perished in this film affected me emotionally, during even its most violent scenarios. It\'s also to note that if actor Ken Watanabe, playing the all-powerful Katsumoto, doesn\'t receive an Oscar nomination for his part in this film, consider me to be the uncle of a monkey.

Yup, Hans Zimmer is back with yet another perfect addition to the film\'s many strengths and a rousing score that was still buzzing in my head as I washed away the tears of the characters gone by.

A bloodbath, however, with a penchant for excessive violence, this film seeks a portrayal of glory and honor through battle in the name of the Emperor. (On an ancillary note: Cruise exercises considerable poetic license, but this is overshadowed by the sheer framework of the story itself--the way it should be for historical narrative.)<p>The Framing of the film.<p>As pointed out in the film, the term \'samurai\' means \'to serve\' and the eeking out of this fidelity to imperial principles is the backdrop for conflict to be settled in a massive bloodletting--what we have here is an eclipsing of the times. Foreign influences invading and suffocating cultural heritage, advanced weaponry and commercialism strangling the Japanese economic and political powers. What frames this contest of arms vs. honor, of modern vs. tradition, is a mutiny of cultural identity that has turned the government in on its own people. A nation whose own traditions are left to the wayside in favor of a \'costume\' of foreign security. This is a country eating itself up--a self-devouring nation ravaging itself and thereby allowing outsiders to ravage it further. This crisis of national identity--the effect of \"wannabes\" donning the latest novelty fad and \"purists\" upholding a cultural epistemology--divides the nation and sets the stage for an unforgettable clash of political ideology.<p>For those who enjoyed the \"Meiji patriotism\" of the samurai exhibited in The Last Samurai, I recommend Yukio Mishima\'s classic novel, Runaway Horses, which chronicles the rise of leftist(\"purist\") resentment towards invading influences that were growing rampant(cancerous) in the nation\'s economic and political sectors during the modern era.'),(764,13,'B0001G6PZC','Dallas Buyers Club','Perfect...They Are All Perfect...','SPOILERS INCLUDED<br /><br />THE LAST SAMURAI is one of the best efforts of Tom Cruise\'s uneven and strange career. Very loosely based on actual events, THE LAST SAMURAI recounts the story of the Satsuma Rebellion of 1877, when the Samurai forced the last stand of traditional Japanese culture against the the modernizing influences of the Meiji Restoration.<br /><br />As part of his drive to bring Japan into the family of nations the Meiji Emperor hired literal armies of foreign advisors. In the film Cruise plays Captain Nathan Algren, a survivor of Gettysburg who later served under Custer and fought Indians on the frontier. The brutalities he has seen have rendered Captain Algren a nightmare-ridden and viciously cynical drunkard. Recruited to go to Japan and train the modern Japanese Army by his despised former superior, Colonel Bagley (Tony Goldwyn), Algren at first adopts the endemic sneering attitude toward the Samurai shared by the \"modernizers\". However, the more he hears of the Samurai, the more respect Algren begins to accord them, much to the disgust of his fellows.<br /><br />When his green army is forced into a premature engagement with the Samurai, Algren is captured and held prisoner by the Samurai leader Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe). Watanabe is the true star of this film. His powerful but understated performance is electric, and Katsumoto\'s character expresses the best of the Bushido Code and of Japanese tradition. As Algren observes his enemies (and they observe him), hatred mellows into distrust, distrust mellows into acquiescence, acquiescence mellows into acceptance, acceptance becomes respect, and respect becomes liking, and then true friendship. Algren, the professional soldier, comes to see the Bushido Code and the disciplined lifestyle of his captors as the highest expression of his own art---the Art of War. When battle comes, Algren casts his lot with the Samurai.<br /><br />Although given a safe passage to Tokyo, Katsumoto is unable to sway the young and timid Meiji Emperor, his former student, who is as much a prisoner of the \"modernizers\" as Algren had been of the Samurai traditionalists. Hostilities flare again when Omura (Masato Harada) the chief of the \"modernizers\" tries to have Katsumoto assassinated. The Samurai withdraw into the mountains and prepare for the final battle. When it comes, the Samurai nearly overwhelm their opponents, but armed with cannons and gatling guns, the modern army is insurmountable. In the end, only Algren survives to bring Katsumoto\'s sword to the Emperor. Although Algren is spat upon by Omura, the Meiji Emperor is so moved by Katsumoto\'s reverence for the old ways that he orders Omura to commit seppuku. In the end, the cowardly Omura merely exiles himself.<br /><br />THE LAST SAMURAI had only a lukewarm reception in the United States. Some reviewers felt that the character of Captain Algren was of the \"White Man\'s Burden\" ilk, that the film was disrespectful of the American historical experience, and that the Samurai were overidealized. Much of this can be put down to a festering dislike of Cruise in the wake of his divorce from Nicole Kidman. However, the film was wildly successful in Japan, and many moviegoers left the theaters in tears, moved by the powerful depiction of traditional Japanese values in the character of Katsumoto and his fellow Samurai. While it is true that much of the Bushido Code was vastly oversimplified in the telling, the essence of Samurai values permeates the film, which, after all, is a form of entertainment, not a philosophical discussion.<br /><br />The \"Extras\" disc is an \"Extras\" disc. Once a pastiche of fascinating folderol, \"Extras\" discs have degenerated into a predictable melange of \"The Making Of...\", pointless commentaries, and deleted scenes we wish had stayed deleted. This one isn\'t much different, though it does have a nice \"Hollywood vs. History\" segment that discusses the real samurai, in truth largely a repressive and regressive elite that had outlived themselves in the 19th century. What might have been very interesting would have been a discussion of how the Bushido Code was institutionally perverted into racist militarism in the first half of the 20th century. The segment barely touches on that subject.<br /><br />A vast and sweeping epic in the vein of <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CX95\">Braveheart</a>, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0783226039\">Spartacus</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CXB2\">Lawrence of Arabia (Limited Edition)</a>, THE LAST SAMURAI is an engaging, respectful, and moving tale well worth watching many more times than once.'),(765,13,'B0001G6PZC','Dallas Buyers Club','Fantastic Movie!

The other performances are also fantastic; the actors are obviously all serious, veteran actors. (They should have an Academy Award for \"Best Casting\"; and this film should have won it.)<br /><br />The film is often graphic (e.g., the final battle scene); but at other times extremely delicate, subtle and sublime (e.g., Cruise\'s scenes with the wife and children of the man whom he killed in battle). Often not a word is said - but the eyes, body movements, and lighting speak to us in soft tones.<br /><br />The Japanese actress KOYUKI (who plays \"Taka\", widow of the warrior Cruise kills in battle near the beginning) is BOTH fantastically beautiful and a most subtle and superb actor.<br /><br />(Koyuki makes Sophie Marceau and Charlize Theron pale by comparison.)<br /><br />This movie is a MUST!'),(766,13,'B0001G6PZC','Dallas Buyers Club','A so moving look at ancestral values','It has battle scenes yes; it has maybe a political point of view, but what really moves about this movie is the marvelous portrayal of values we often forget about.

Watanabe also has a breakthrough role, in which he is part of a group of legendary samurai warriors. This movie is a burrito of action, suspense, and drama all rolled up into one.

But the main message in the movie is not just see how the samurais fought in battelfield, and cut the throats of their enemies, or how the technology crushed the samurais, no this is not the real point or message, the big deal is that we must remember who we are and where we come from.

The example of the Demopolis attack made by persians in the old Greece, was very accord with the last battle, when it\'s explained by Tom Cruise (Nathan Algren) to Ken Watanabe (Katsumoto)and he used the word &quot;million&quot; and 300, drawing to the samurai that: &quot;If you only fight because you want to win... you are lost, but if you are commited to die in the intent you will win more than the battle, you will get Honor and you will make that the reason to fight can be heared by those that you wanted to hear you.&quot;<br /><br /> Don\'t give up.'),(784,14,'B0001G6PZC','Dallas Buyers Club','Dances with the Samurai...','First off, let me state that this is an enjoyable film to watch.  It is entertaining and truly worth a watch.  However...<p>It is basically a rehash of Dances with Wolves (check out the Samurai village and the Native American references): unhappy, unsatisfied white guy finds himself in an exotic (to him) culture and, much to his surprise and everyone else\'s, he finds his salvation there and goes native.  Not only does he find his salvation there but he becomes their savior against the white people who are corrupting such an idyllic culture.  Apparently, the world needs more white guys to save them (and everyone else) from themselves.<p>I suppose, in this day and age, American history is being rewritten and our guilty consciences of our ignorance of other cultures leads us to make movies such as this one.  We have misunderstood other cultures for far too long and it is up to the American film industry to make American movies to help Americans understood how wrong Americans have been!<p>The pretense is that this movie is meant to honor the Samurai.  We see the serenity of the idyllic life of the Samurai, the happy children, the Buddhist chants and all that other stuff that falls just short of stereotyping.  It feels as if someone studied the Samurai in books (and old Samurai movies) and wrote a movie about it, trying to give it a twist.  But it all centers around Tom Cruise.  The Samurai in the end are pretty much props.  In the end it feels a bit, well, pretentious.  And predictable.<p>The action scenes are fun to watch (though Kill Bill\'s got this one beat) and fantasize a bit about such an idyllic life.  But it\'s been taken just a bit too serious.  But still worth a watch.<p>By the way, The Gods Must Be Crazy covers this ground (what happens when two cultures collide) with a more comical, intelligent and subversive spin.'),(785,14,'B0001G6PZC','Dallas Buyers Club','Currently in my top 10 fav\'s of all time.','This movie being categorized as action, pretty much misrepresents what it\'s about.  Yes, it has action in it (amazing battle scenes), however it\'s central theme has to deal with honor, the loss of it, and the loss of a way of life in exchange for a more modern society.  On the one hand you have the Japanese civilization in the middle of adopting a more Western style of living, and on the other you have the Samurai, more than willing to die fighting to keep Japanese tradition alive.<br /><br />  Now, some people say the title of this movie refers to Tom Cruise\'s character, others (including me) say it refers to Watanabe\'s character, Katsumoto, who loosely represents the real life Saigo Takamori, the real life samurai who was considered the actual &quot;last samurai&quot;.  Some reviewers also describe Tom\'s character, Algren, as the white man who swoops in to save the day.  I say he was simply a bystander caught up in the events of history.  It\'s not impossible to believe that a white man can get involve with the samurai, since this idea is borrowed from actual history of a westerner who adopts the samurai way of life during the rise of the Shogunate.<br /><br />  No matter who\'s name is credited first though, it wouldn\'t be much of a movie without the cast.  With that said, Ken Watanabe, Hiro Sanada, and Koyuki make this movie.  No offense to Tom Cruise since he was impressive in doing all of his own sword work.  However, it is obvious that his character takes a back seat to what is supposedly the secondary plot of the samurai.  Frankly, this isn\'t Cruise\'s movie, it simply has Cruise in it.'),(786,14,'B0001G6PZC','Dallas Buyers Club','One of my favorite films','I have never been a fan of Tom Cruise, but after watching this movie my opinion of him has slowly begin to change.  Granted, Cruise is a good actor, but there are several others I would place ahead of him in terms of acting ability and on camera congeniality.  Nevertheless, I believe The Last Samurai is one of Tom Cruise\'s best films, if not his best film ever, because he does an outstanding job of portraying the role of Capt. Nathan Algren;  Algren is a Civil War and Indian War veteran who is tortured over the atrocities he has viewed and committed on the front lines.  These experiences have transformed Algren into a man filled with bitterness and cynicism and driven him to embrace alcohol as his escape mechanism from reality.  <p>Cruise does an excellent job of capturing this particular spirit in the film.  Even though Cruise\'s performance is excellent, the film is only bolstered by the performances by the performances of Watanabe and the rest of the cast.  Watanabe was simply terrific as the Samurai warlord, Katsumoto.  On screen he exuded a kind of gentle but stern warrior aura, and showed he was a man of astute intellectual abilities.  In his performace Watanabe displayed all the qualities and characteristics that were essential to the Samurai.  Besides the performances the battle sequences and costumes were spectacular.  In addition, the scenery and setting were also very good and captured the atmosphere of a 19th century Japan that was experiencing rapid Westernization.  At several instances in the film it is easy to see vestiges of traditional Eastern Japansese culture stand side by side with modern Western culture.  Last but not least, the musical score by Hans Zimmer is phenomenal. As always, Zimmer delivers a rousing an emotional score that complements the film and actually heightens the sensitivity at certain crucial moments of the film.<p>My only criticism of this movie is that Tom Cruise was focued upon too much.  It would have been nice if the other characters, Ujio, Taka, and Katsumoto, received more screen time since they were all so likeable and each delivers a great performance.  Slight criticism aside, this is one of my favorite movies of all time and one I would recommend to virtually anyone who asked.'),(787,14,'B0001G6PZC','Dallas Buyers Club','Satisfying and engaging Samurai epic. One of 2003s best!','The Last Samurai is everything a movie should be - exciting, emotional, and involving. Though I would not go so far to say that it\'s a masterpiece, it is one of the better movies I have seen in 2003, and without having seen the new \"Lord of the Rings\", it\'s definitely near the top of the list. It will no doubt draw comparison with \"Braveheart\" because of the epic battles and the emotional climax, but thankfully avoids becoming derivative of other \"battle epics\".<p>Tom Cruise (who spent two years learning Japanese) plays Nathan Algren, a civil war hero who has fallen off the right path and is now washed up and heavily into the booze. His fortunes change when he is commissioned by the Emperor of Japan to help train his army to fight efficiently against the Samurai who roam the country. His success with that endeavor is short lived when he is captured by the Samurai during a devastating battle. He spends the next several months living among them and adopting their ways, and growing fond of the discipline, skill, and tact that the Samurai display. Knowing of the Emperor\'s motives to rid Japan of the people and way of life he has come to embrace, he joins them in their battle against insurmountable odds. <p>There are many subplots and characters, some predictable Hollywood fodder (do you smell a love story cooking?), but most are effective and necessary to the overall story. \"The Last Samurai\" is tempered with humorous moments that help to balance the violence that is peppered throughout. As you can expect, many of the battles are long, drawn out, and very bloody. But the violence is never gratuitous, and it knows it\'s limits. As far as performances go, Tom Cruise is nothing if not reliable, and his largely Japanese supporting cast all do a great job in hitting their cues and making us believe in them. What really deserves special mention is the cinematography, which captures Japans lush valleys, majestic temples, and overall aesthetic beauty. The battle choreography is also stellar, obviously benefiting for painstaking direction and CGI effects. <p>\"The Last Samurai\" is not a history lesson, so you are unlikely to walk away from it having gained a substantial knowledge of the Samurai customs and traditions. What you will get out of it is a fantastic movie-going experience that satisfies on every level, which is exactly what we go to movies for.'),(788,15,'B0001G6PZC','Dallas Buyers Club','A beautiful requiem for traditional warriors of all kinds','Former Paramount studios chief Robert Evans used to call his holiday pictures \"Christmas gifts to the world,\" and \"The Last Samurai\" is staged just so: Much of it is handsome, magnificent and morally decent, yet the movie is full of itself, in both solemnity and faraway gaze. Edward Zwick\'s latest giant is in need of a bit of exuberance to push it over into classic status, and the director never quite gets enough of it, and certainly not from star Tom Cruise, in permanent furrowed brow. <p>Developed from an interesting story by John Logan, \"The Last Samurai\" concerns Capt. Nathan Algren (Cruise), a drunk, disillusioned cavalry solider in 1870s hired to train a \"modernized\" Japanese army defeat the legendary mountain samurais, whose \"bushido\" code of discipline has long defended the nation. The samurai are led by their last great fighter, Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe), fight by sword and bow, and have the fealty of the people. The upwardly mobile Japanese ambassador Omura (Masato Harada) has the ear of the young emperor (Shichinosuke Nakamura). <p>Bushido code is such that Katsumoto would drop his sword if the emperor wished it so; until then, he leads charges against green Japanese troops. In one battle, pitched in the forest by fog light, he wounds Algren, captures him and ushers the captain to a mountain hideout to study his recovering enemy. The samurai village is beautifully realized; Zwick and cinematographer John Toll (\"Braveheart\") purposely create a utopia at high elevation. With a valley in the distance reminiscent of a fertile green ocean, Algren begins to adjust to the mood and practice of the warriors and prove himself worthy of it while kindling a romance with a samurai\'s widow (beautiful, expressive Koyuki).  <p>While Katsumoto may belong to an ancient order, he speaks English, displays a quick sense of humor and seeks to trade wisdom with Algren rather than merely dispensing it. His philosophy is unbending, but his moods aren\'t. Watanabe is so good because he plays against the expectation of the stern, authoritarian titan, and, with a smile, steals most of the scenes away from Cruise, who affects the broken man about as well as a naturally expressive actor can. <p>Inevitably, Algren wins a few mock battles and stands beside Katsumoto during a midnight ninja attack, setting the stage for Algren\'s conflicted return back to his old post in Tokyo, then his subsequent change of heart that leads to fierce final battle between tradition and guns, played out in the valley we\'ve seen from afar the entire movie.<p>Four-act films are rare, but Zwick doesn\'t fight the built-in structure, uses it, in fact to cover all the political bases, punctuating the end of each with a clash of some sort. The ninja raid has a hint of Kurosawa, while the forest sequences echoes the Vietnam movies of Stone and Coppola. The final battle is a close cousin to \"Braveheart\" and deserves to be mentioned with it. Cruise and Watanabe worked the swords themselves, and betray no weaknesses. Zwick is a fabulous combat director, and considering the movie\'s scope, deserves a mention during awards season.<p>\"The Last Samurai\" never quite reconciles what movie it prefers to be. It forces a romance between Algren and Taka, the widow, when there\'s no time to develop it. It tacks on a needless, uplifting epilogue to a naturally earth-moving conclusion. The movie errs on the side of being disconsolate, too, in portraying the one-dimensionally evil Omura and Col. Bagley (Tony Goldwyn), one of Algren\'s former superiors who enjoyed slaughtering innocents in Indian raids. Such stark lines of romance and villainy detract from the movie\'s underlying elegy of samurais courting death against the machines.'),(789,21,'B0001G6PZC','Dallas Buyers Club','A good solid movie . . . but not great','The Last Samurai is entertaining.<br />I got involved with the characters and wanted everything to turn out well.<br />The action sequences are well done.<br />The acting is well done.<p>However,<br />The plot is formula.<br />The ending, while throwing in a twist or two is still predictable.<br />The moral theme has been done to the hilt.<p>In Short,<br />This is a good movie to rent, but I wouldn\'t spend a lot of money to add it to my collection.'),(790,26,'B0001G6PZC','Dallas Buyers Club','Movie of the Year - The Last Samurai','By far this is the best movie that I\'ve seen in a long while.

Unfortunately the photography, while adequate, seemed to be uninspired and just very bland. The score also leaves something to be desired. During the first battle scene I found the music seemed to detract from the intensity of the battle and what should have been heart-pounding and overwhelming effect seemed more anticlimactic than anything. There were also a few scenes that used computer generated images landscapes/battle scenes which were just below todays standards.<br />In the end however the film was carried by strong supporting characters and a believeable Tom Cruise.

I knew this film could easily be misunderstood, and whereas I had doubts myself in the beginning, after watching it they had all but removed and I was in love with it. As with all good films, this one had picked the right people to play the characters. This had included Katsumoto, Omura, Emperor, Taka, Simon Graham, the Americans, even the guardian. It smartly blends in the flares and drama in both American and Japanese cultures and anyone who can appreciate both cultures can easily testify to great illustration of both. The film could easily be misunderstood for a few reasons: 1. most audience may appreciate one of the two cultures presented in the movies, but not both, thus appreciation for half of the movies would be blanked out. 2. because the film touches on a historical event, it would most likely be criticized for its accuracy. this is a mistake, however, since audience should realize that this is hollywood after all, and the director had never intended or claimed to make a documentary, he is making a movie. as most movies are strictly fictional, the fact that this is actually \"based on a significant historical event\" is of great educational value.<br /><br />Having some understanding and appreciation of the Japanese culture before  viewing this, have to say that this illustration of the Japanese culture was absolutely true and beautiful. And whereas originally I had thought the idea of Tom Cruise being a samurai might be tacky, but the sequence of events, the transformation of his character into becoming one, had made it seem surprisingly natural. Though the film is about conflict and warriors, and it was supposed to be heavy with bloodsheds and killing, the story blended in enough light hearted sub-plots to actually allow the audience to breathe and smile at times amist the serious storyline of a part of a nation\'s tradition becoming extinct. The balance in the movie was very well done. Tom Cruise\'s character\'s integration into a part of Japanese culture itself is a success story. There would probably be more countless stories of how this type of integration would\'ve failed, but Tom\'s character had succeeded. It did so through respect, appreciation, camaraderie, and deep feelings. The references to western cultures on occasion had been also very smart. There is a sense of comfort in that even if the warriors had fought to their death in their cause, they were actually not alone, as other nations, people, in near and distance past, have also fought to death for theirs.<br /><br />Other than that, as a movie, the cinematography, the music and sound, the the historical illustrations, the traspassing of two cultures that in most people\'s eyes are largely incompatible, the entertaining value, should make this one of the top movies ever had. The box office did not give it all the credits.<br /><br />This is highly recommended, and even if certain things in the movie may seem strange at first, it is definitely worth watching. Someday these things that did not make sense might in rare instances come to light. Along with what might come to light though, is the awareness also that this is really a movie, and reality may not be as pretty as it is set out to tell....'),(829,17,'B0001G6PZC','Dallas Buyers Club','This Movie Captured My Attention','I\'m not big on movies.

Cruise plays an Army officer who fought in Civil and Indian wars - not quite sure about both, but in either case, he\'d have a bit more crow feet and gray hairs than Cruise.  Otherwise, the pace, character development, etc was good.  The final battle scene was a bit dragged out but I think was done for effect.

Of course, Katsumoto is a fictional character as well.<br /><br />For those of you who are interested, the following is a short survey of the situation in Japan, which the movie attempts to cover.<br /><br />Katsumoto is based upon Saig+- Takamori, was one of the most influential samurai in Japanese history, who lived during the late Edo Period and early Meiji Era. As a low-level samurai, he was recruited to travel to Edo, modern day Tokyo, to assist Shimazu Nariakira, daimyo of Satsuma han. He was later put in command of over fifty thousand samurai, a large part of the imperial army.<br /><br />Saig+- initially disagreed with the modernization of Japan and the opening of commerce with the West. He did insist, however, that Japan should go to war with Korea because of their refusal to recognize the legitimacy of the Emperor Meiji as head of state of the Empire of Japan. But because the other leaders of the restoration strongly opposed these plans out of budgetary and cost considerations, Saig+- resigned and returned to his hometown of Kagoshima.<br /><br />Shortly thereafter, he established a private academy in Kagoshima for the faithful samurai that had also resigned their posts in order to follow him from Tokyo. In 1877, led by Saig+-, they revolted against the central government (the Satsuma Rebellion), which had just eliminated their rice stipends. The imperial palace had recruited new guards who had previously been rice-growing peasants. They were armed with modern weapons. The samurai, lead by Saig+-, also being equipped with modern weapons, were able to seriously challenge the imperial army in battle for several months. Badly injured in the hip during the final battle, the Battle of Shiroyama, instead of being killed or captured by the enemy, Saig+- asked for his head to be cut off by a comrade to preserve his honor. Legend and art show that Saig+- committed seppuku, a traditional form of suicide.<br /><br />It is actually unknown what the exact style of his death was. The accounts of his subordinates claim either that he up righted himself and committed seppuku after his injury, or that he requested a comrade assist his suicide. In debate, some scholars have suggested that neither is the case, and that Saig+- may have gone into shock following his wound, losing his ability to speak. Several comrades upon seeing him in this state, would have severed his head, assisting him in the warrior\'s suicide they knew he would have wished. Later, they would have told that he committed seppuku in order to preserve his status as a true samurai. In any case, the head was hidden by a retainer and never found. This was unsettling to the government, as it was the head that would prove his death in battle. The lack of closure allowed for many folktales to be created, saying that Saig+- was still alive and plotting revenge.'),(833,17,'B0001G6PZC','Dallas Buyers Club','death of honor and the beginning of modern world','The best acting from Cruise since Magnolia.

All these are just trimmings, they would have been enough to make the movie interesting but the movie is not an action, or historical drama, or adventure.<br /><br />The movie is about that sad period of human history when individual values were sacrificed to obedience to orders, personal warrior skill and art replaced with cheap soldier \"cannon fodder\" mass, indiviudal honor and responsibility gave way to the power of human rabble.<br /><br />It was easier to show on Japan\'s example but same thing gradually happened in Europe and US as well - it took longer so the change was less stunning, but no less dramatic.<br /><br />The movie for those who still believe in the word \"honor\", the movie for (who said that great phrase?) \"romantics who were mugged by life\".'),(834,17,'B0001G6PZC','Dallas Buyers Club','The Last Samurai','Excellent movie...........I highly recommend anyone who has not seen this movie should see it asap.

For instance, I enjoyed watching &quot;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon&quot; even though I know people can not fly. Even though I knew when I was watching this film that the historical portrayal was inaccurate, I still found the movie a very entertaining story. And it is my understanding that the making of this film was an attempt to honor the noble life of the Samurai that once existed in Japan.  <p>This is a 2 and 1/2 hour movie that for me went by in what felt like minutes! I was very pleasantly surprised by this movie. I avoided seeing it in the theatre because I really didn\'t believe it would be so good nor did I think that I could find Tom Cruise believable as a Samurai. I\'m not sure that I was ever convinced watching the film that Tom Cruise had truly became a Samurai, but none the less the strong storyline makes this film work! As does the great support acting from Ken Watanabe! And the other Samurai characters are developed enough in the plot that you do care what happens to them and feel sad when they die.<p>I did have a few reservations about the film. Most notable, I was a little disappointed in the ending in that the film had to go completely Hollywood and have the Japanese girl and the white man get together and presumably &quot;live happily ever after&quot;. I thought a much better ending would have been to have Cruise\'s character die on the battlefield. If he had truly became a Samurai wouldn\'t he have wanted this as was the fates of the other Samurai?'),(837,18,'B0001G6PZC','Dallas Buyers Club','Predictably Re-Hashed Theme','The Last Samurai, as mentioned by another reviewer above, has a lot of parallels in movies such as \"Dances With Wolves\". The whole wash-up, has-been hero finds a new sense of self and identity with people once perceived as \"barbarian\" or \"savage\". The theme has been done before and probably will be again.<br /><br />In \"The Last Samurai\", Capt. Algren is sent to Japan during the tale end of the Meiji Restoration to train the new Imperial Army in modern warfare. Despite the excellent pay, Algren is an alcoholic with some serious personality issues to boot. The new Imperial Army is soon sent into battle with the other problem: a rebel force of samurai led by Katsumoto, (Ken Watanabe). The results are predictably disastrous and Algren is captured alive. The rest of the plot follows a predictable pattern that most will be familiar with.<br /><br />The character of Katsumoto is actually based, albeit very loosely, on a real person whol live during a similar time and fought in Kyushu. The real man was one Saigo Takamori, who also committed seppuku according to legend. He actually died from bullet wounds sustained during his last stand near Kagoshima. A good book about the man is <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0471705373\">The Last Samurai: The Life and Battles of Saigo Takamori</a>, which is also an excellent read.<br /><br />Tom Cruise puts in an excellent performance, I have to say, as the dysfunctional Algren. Ken Watanabe is amazing in his protrayal of the samurai rebel leader, Katsumoto, bringing an intensity and depth to the movie that can be lacking in other characters.<br /><br />There are some small issues of error, such as ferns and so on in the forests. Being shot in New Zealand, the movie has some scenery from that country that is visibly not Japanese. However, these points are very small and do not take away from the spectacle of the film and its location.<br /><br />The battle scenes are truly amazing, and well shot. There is enough action and some comic relief to keep everyone pretty well entertained. The cultural differences between Algren and his Japanese hosts are a source of some amusement, especially as the younger samurai take a liking to him. This is despite the regular beatings he receives from older samurai he tries to take on.<br /><br />Despite the predictability of the movie, and the lack of originality in some regards, I thoroughly enjoyed it. I liked the style, the action, and the plot, and came away feeling thoroughly entertained and somewhat moved.

And give you an idea how the samurai and their families lived.<br /><br />Not only is this a great teaching tool but it\'s great entertainment.  It\'s not that bad of a movie.  There\'s a little humor in it and some serious moments where you can actually learn something about life itself.<br /><br />This movie has actually sparked my interest in the Japanese history.

The real history of the last stand of samurai. The thing to remember is that the romantic image we hold dear doesn\'t really reflect the reality of samurai. By the way, they prefered to be known as Bushi (Warrior) not Samurai (servant). The ideal we have today is rather the same as the ideal of the Authurian knights. I do admit, I really enjoyed the movie, but I wish sometimes history would be presented a little more often, rather than a story passed off as such. I don\'t think anyone is trying to fool the audience, after all, we are talking about art here.

Yes, there are battles with blood spilled all over but this is accessory to the plot. The story is what appealed to me. The old Japan is lost and it is a shame. This revives it and exposes people to the Japanese culture. Being able to turn back the clock and achieve this level of realism and show the lost pride of the Japanese is an  amazing feat. Of course there is a touch of Hollywood but that\'s ok. Cruise is at his best in this movie surrounded by talented Japanese actors. Ken Watanabe is simply brilliant.'),(842,19,'B0001G6PZC','Dallas Buyers Club','A Good Attempt to bring the Samurai Story to Life','Most people in North America don\'t know who the Japanese Director Akira Kurosawa is.  Nor do they know much about the Samurai. Many of Hollywood\'s most recognized filmmakers have been deeply influenced by the Japanese director including, but not limited to, George Lucas, Steven Spielberg, Martin Scorsese and John Woo. Most of Akira\'s films were about the Samurai and the complex warrior ethos that drove the development of some very meaningful and artistic storylines.<br /><br />I think this movie is a very good introduction to the everyday North American (i.e. white) audience of the Samurai and their warrior culture. There are some things that a Western audience may find difficult to understand or accept, an example being the wife of a fallen Samurai who tends to the wounds of her husband\'s killer. This is hard for a Western audience to understand, but in a traditional Asian culture, if your parents are dead, then your older brother becomes the moral equivalent of your father and you do what he says, no arguments. Not PC I know, but that was reality back then. Plus, I think the wife knew enough about war, being raised in a Samurai tradition, to know that there was nothing personal in what Algren did.<br /><br />To make a movie with wide appeal, Zwick had to dilute the Japanese culture for wider consumption, kind of like the \"green\" bottle top soy sauce that\'s less salty then regular  \"red\" bottle top soy sauce. However, this had too much of a \"crowd pleaser\" kind of effect on me, as I wanted to learn more about the Japanese culture at that important time in their history. The makers (and financiers) of this movie decided to entertain first and educate later. However, at least people will get something out of this, instead of just gawking at the natives. The film was beautifully shot, the acting more then adequate, and the period costumes and props were exquisite and extremely accurate.'),(843,19,'B0001G6PZC','Dallas Buyers Club','A Glorious Film','The Last Samurai is a beautiful film, the kind of epic that David Lean might have made.  The film is true to historical events that happened in Japan during 1876-77.  In particular, meticulous care was taken with the recreation of Tokyo and the clothing that was being worn, traditional Japanese and modern clothing. The clash of tradition versus the influence of the West is sharply portrayed in these contrasts. Like all historical epics, departures and simplifications of the truth have to be made for the sake of a coherent film.  Certainly, there were no Americans fighting along with the samurai but the character of Captain Algren allows us to explore what is going on in Japan from the traditional and modernistic points of view.  What makes The Last Samurai an excellent historical film is what also makes for a great historical novel: sticking close to historical facts, knowing the details of the society your characters are living in and developing a believable and interesting story.  The story of The Last Samurai fulfills all of this for me.<br /><br />Edward Zwick has captured some excellent performances.  Tom Cruise as Captain Algren has a truly memorable performance, one that he trained for several months to deliver.  I must confess that I was not a early fan of Tom Cruise but his work in recent years has been impressive and in this film he truly becomes the character he is portraying. Ken Watanabe is wonderful as Kasumoto, loosely based on the life of Saigo Takamori, capturing the essence of the duty of a samurai and also the contemplative side of a warrior.  The talk of his writing a poem on a blossom reminded me that prior to the real battle depicted in the film the warriors spent the night before engaged in writing poetry.  The performances by the supporting cast are excellent.  Of special note is Koyuki (playing Taka, Kasumoto\'s sister) who must care for the man who killed her husband and who gradually finds herself falling in love.  Her sensitive performance is one of the highlights of the film.  Shin Koyamada, who plays Kasumoto\'s son Nobutada, brings pathos to his character, particularly in the scene where he is humiliated by Japanese soldiers for being dressed as a samurai.<br /><br />The battle sequences were carefully stage with an eye for authenticity and the village where Algren is kept a prisoner was so meticulously constructed that the Japanese extras were struck by its resemblance to the villages where they grew up.<br /><br />The cinematography is very impressive and the music by Hans Zimmer beautifully builds the mood.  The DVD has some wonderful supplemental pieces that explain various aspects of the production of the film. The Last Samurai is a film that will be highly regarded years from now as among the best Hollywood has produced.'),(844,19,'B0001G6PZC','Dallas Buyers Club','Masterful','This is a great movie.

It\'s about two completely different peoples learning about eachother while incresingly understanding and accepting a way of life that is not their own.  Oh, and there ARE some great battle scenes.<br /><br />I was a little sceptical when I was about to watch this the first time, but it blew my expectations away, and I loved it.  Very few movies can bring this man to tears, but the end of this movie accomplished just that.  Do yourself a favor and get a copy of this powerful film.'),(845,25,'B0001G6PZC','Dallas Buyers Club','It\'s not about Tom Cruise','I know what you\'re thinking: Another simple Tom Cruise character in a simple plot. Yes, at first glance the film isn\'t promising. The plot, although based on some real events, is clich&eacute;d struggle by a small band against overwhelming odds. After the first glance the outlook brightens, the Cruise character, Nathan Algren, doesn\'t lead the small band or even effect course of the action much. The result is a Tom Cruise film that doesn\'t revolve around Tom Cruise and in which Cruise does some genuine acting.<br /><br />One reason Cruise fairs so well is Algren, traumatized and haunted, doesn\'t have the usual cocky bluster that Cruise relies on so much. The end result is not a stellar performance but may be one of his better ones. Additionally Cruise isn\'t the real star here, the rest of the mostly Japanese cast is. The Japanese cast are veteran actors but unknown outside of Japan. The cinematography also really stands out. Beautiful outdoor settings in both Japan and New Zealand where shot with care. The music is mix of John Williams-type orchestral arraignments with a Japanese influence.<br /><br />The lack of real antagonist is the one major flaw. Enlisted to stand in for one, are several characters proposing to change Japan into a more modern country similar to the US and Europe, but this is never developed well so it seems the small band of Samari are fighting against, well, something. This contrasts with the real events with a real effort to push the Samari out of their powerful influence in feudal Japan. Since this the conflict is mostly neglected the movie is forced the point out the differences in not-too-subtle ways even giving one central character an \'evil guy\' goatee.<br /><br />The Director\'s Commentary track is good and serviceable but it\'s just that, the Director\'s Commentary. Alone the director covers as many topics as possible but the track isn\'t as broad as commentaries that include other crew members with other specialties. There also isn\'t any discussion that can make some commentaries so enjoyable. The other special features are a disappointment. Several of the \'documentaries\' consist of Cruise and/or the director talking about how great the movie is. The two technical features about wardrobe and weapons are ridiculously short at about five minutes each.<br /><br />And the overwhelming odds plot? That can end in only one of two ways: The small band manages to win or is wiped out out to the last man.  While you\'ll have to see for yourself which way this film ends, it does have more going for it than a clich&eacute;d plot.'),(846,20,'B0001G6PZC','Dallas Buyers Club','The heart and soul of Japan - A story of Love and Honor.','Many have seen this wonder of a movie.

The second disk has special features including interviews with the actors and what I think is worth the price of the DVD by itself: The code of the Samurai.  The meaning and essential core of Bushido - what has guided generations of Japanese - is exemplified in these writings.  We, in America, living in an age of twisted values and dishonor - the Code of the Samurai is a necessary template for our youth.<br /><br />Ken Watanabe, along with the many Japanese actors, are supurb.

It is very touchingly done - you cannot help but feel the pain - for parents - your paternal and maternal instincts will emerge and highten.

This would be the infamous Custer\'s calvary. The Custer who opened up \"Thieves Road\" to the Black Hills. The same calvary that went looking for one helpless Native American village too many. The Captain left the calvary before its demise at Little Big Horn. He is imbued with nightmares from the massacre of the Southern Cheyenne. This is the first historically accurate portrayal of Custer EVER by Hollywood.<br /><br />These two contexts are the heart of this movie and it is amazing to see how a cowboy becomes an indian. Cruise isn\'t bad in this movie but I\'m not raving about it because of him. The Japanese actors are absolutely engrossing in their first film before western audiences. They are credible and believable and there is a complete absence of the overacting ubiquitious in so many films. Ken Watanabe has the key role as the Last Samurai leader, Katsumoto, who is dedicated heart and soul to the code of bushido. He is also the heart and soul of this movie. Shin Koyamada plays Nobutada, the son of Katsumoto and is unforgettable. We are also introduced to a captivatingly beautiful actress Koyuki, who plays the sister of Katsumoto and wife of a samurai slain by Algren.<br /><br />There are so many great lines and enveloping dialogue but the best is when Cruise character tells Colonel Bagley:<br /><br />\"You want me to kill THE ENEMIES of Jappos, I\'ll kill THE ENEMIES of Jappos... Rebs, The Souix, The Cheyenne... For $500 a month I\'ll kill whoever you want. But keep one thing in mind, I\'d gladly kill you for free.\"<br /><br />This movie is about duty and honor and being faithful to these principles. It is also about the power of redemption that can be acheived by commiting to these values. This makes a great double feature along with Kurosawa\'s Ran. It is the first Tom Cruise movie that I\'ve ever purchased!'),(863,10,'B0001G6PZC','Dallas Buyers Club','Dances with Braveheart','Throw in a wolf and some blue face paint and that\'s pretty much what you\'ve got: Dances with Wolves meets Braveheart.

Tom Cruise carries the film brilliantly and outshines any other cast member by far, partly because his character was the only one that was shown to develop.<p>The message of the film is a very positive one, that of honor and courage, even in the face of unbeatable odds, a code almost completely foreign to the average American. Even with this, it\'s a still a somewhat depressing film, watching the demise of an ancient and majestic society, which was traded in for the pop culture of the West.<p>At times the action was a little overwhelming for this type of film. At one point there was an attack from ninjas that almost degenerated into Kill Bill Vol. 1 - a little too much ninja for the epic journey film maybe. The last criticism is a technical one - while the cinematography was wonderful, the sets were not. There are times, mostly at the beginning when we see shots of San Francisco, and then a distance shot of Mt. Fuji, that it looks less real than a Bob Ross painting.

The story revolves around tormented Civil War veteran Captain Nathan Algren (Tom Cruise) who is coerced to train the Japanese Emperor\'s troops in the use of modern western weaponry.  Standing in the way is a rebellion of samurai warriors led by Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe in his Oscar nominated role) who refuse to let go of their honorable traditions despite being at a disadvantage.  When Algren is captured, he learns and eventually adopts the way of the samurai; culminating in a would be epic battle that ends with a whimper.  It seemed screenwriter John Logan had bigger plans, but the Hollywood conventions injected here from director Edward Zwick and Cruise hamper what could have been something really special.  That aside though, the Last Samurai is still a great film, and Cruise and Watanabe are brilliant when both share the screen.

I kept feeling like I\'d seen this movie before.<p>Actually, the movie works best when it\'s in &quot;Dances&quot; mode, chronicling the adventures of a depressed white Civil War hero (Cruise in the Costner role) who adopts the lifestyle and teachings of a threatened civilization and ends up defending said civilization against encroaching white society. This is the most compelling aspect of the movie, even though its structure is borrowed whole from a film that most people now claim to despise because of its &quot;political correctness.&quot;<p>Cruise is very good as Nathan Algren, the alien in 19th century Japan, caught in the middle of a civil war of another kind, between ancient Samurai warriors and a government seeking to &quot;modernize&quot; itself with weapons imported from the U.S. He\'s bested by Ken Watanabe as a Samurai tribal chief interested in learning the ways of his enemy. Algren eventually becomes an honorary Samurai himself and fights against his own people, in a climactic battle lifted entirely from &quot;Braveheart.&quot;<p>Most of the action scenes are exciting, and there\'s plenty of Bushido lore and swordplay to keep Samurai enthusiasts happy. The photography is gorgeous, too.

Algren is captured by the samurai and becomes an ally of Katsumoto (Ken Wantanabe), the samurai leader.<br />I\'m not a huge Cruise fan, but I do think this is one of his better performances. He seems to have a knack for displaying self-disgust (MAGNOLIA) and he taps into it here. The film\'s first act is its strongest part. Cruise is believably decrepit, and the opening battle, where the samurai swoop down on the frightened Japanese soldiers, is haunting. Indeed all of the action scenes are very well put together.<br />In the film\'s middle section, Cruise learns how wonderful it is to be Japanese and follow the way of the Samurai. This seems to consist of walking around, meditating, and practicing swordfighting. Cruise and Wantanabe have several metaphysical conversations, and Wantanabe performs with wonderful wit and economy, but nothing happens for far too long.<br />THE LAST SAMURAI is entertaining, if a bit bloated, and contains several superior action sequences.'),(869,27,'B0001G6PZC','Dallas Buyers Club','A sweeping epic!','1876 in Japan, an American soldier named Nathan Algren (Tom Cruise) has been hired by the Emperor Meijii to train some Japanese soldiers to fight against the savage Samurai.

Although very similar to films like \"Man Named Horse\", \"Dances with Wolves\", \"Lawrence of Arabia\" or \"Last of the Mohicans\" this one takes the old story of those to Japan instead of being in the western times or the French-Indian war or Arabia.

In the opening battle he is captured by the Samurai and it is then that he can see the parallel with the Indians and eventually switches sides. All this is beautifully filmed and some of the scenes in the Samurai village, when Captain Algren is gradually adapting to the Samurai way of life reminded me of Kevin Costners Dances with Wolves.<br /><br />I am not especially a fan of Tom Cruise but he is good in this. However it is Ken Watanabe as the Samurai leader Katsumoto who shines throughout the film. In supporting roles Billy Connelly and Timothy Spall are both<br />very good.<br /><br />Sadly in the last half hour the film lost a lot of credibility for me, hence I have only given it four stars.

Well, the reviewer said something about the view of the \"whiteman\'s burden\" made have caused unpleasant reactions.. that could be part of the reason, but my opinion is, the movie was released at a bad political timing and was censored by Hollywood as part of the \"Patriot\" canpaign designed at getting moral support to the invasion of Irak<br /><br />Now you may label me now as a \"conspiracy paranoid\", but let me deliniate some aspects too see if they are not logical.. in the movie, americans go to Japan as mercenaries with a agenda of opening the big arms trade with imperial Japan.. to make matters worse, an ethical crisis occurs to the character of Tom Cruise.. an actor who is still remembered as a patriotic pilot who shot down those dreaded MICs in \"Top Gun\" ( a movie destined to make the public feel good at their defense expenditure)... talk about a bad timing to reflect and see that your goverment; not only sends you to genocide the american indians, now its time to continue somewhere else!! and what\'s even worse, he joins the other side!!, not exactly the kind of attitude you need on the troop morale sent to invade Irak under weak grounds.. hell, was it not enough the catharsis done by all those Vietnam movies?

If the \"I haven\'t figured out the right dose of Ritalin to take yet\" presence of Tom Cruise grates on your nerves as much as it does mine, you\'ll be pleasantly surprised to find that he at times gives a measured and even subtle performance as a shell-shocked cavalry officer prostituting himself to teach the Japanese military the brutally efficient techniques of Western warfare.  His supporting cast of talented Asian actors is better, though even Ken Watanabe, who at times resembles Lawrence Fishburne in expression and intensity, is no Toshiro Mifune.  Where the movie breaks down is with John Logan\'s shallow script, which like most Western films about the East, implies complexity mostly by making Asians esoteric and tight-lipped; but for all of the posturing, there is no real wisdom offered in a story meant to explore culture clash.  Instead, viewers are distracted by battle scenes that probably would have seemed grand had the aforementioned films (with corrected titles), as well as \"Gladiator\" and \"The Last of the Mohicans,\" not beaten this one to the punch.  Zwick even plagiarizes his own film, the much better \"Glory,\" and fans of Hans Zimmer\'s \"The Thin Red Line\" soundtrack will be pleased to note that some of it seems to make its way into this film.  All in all, \"The Last Samurai\" isn\'t a bad film.

This film is a wonderful exploration of interaction among societies and how the world as a diverse planet can learn from one another. The film was excellent because it really showed the audience about Samurai life and built on the characters and their ideologies. We learn through watching how a Samurai grows up trained to obey the emperor and lives by honor. Through the intense character development comes the importance of the ending. Cruise also gave a good performance but as you\'ve all heard, Ken Watanabe steals the show. Hans Zimmer\'s score also brought the movie to life as does all of his incredible scores for their movies.

Tom Cruise, maybe in his best performance ever, plays Nathan Algren, a veteran of the Civil War that now lives in oblivion as an alcoholic ad-boy for a weapons company. He\'s invited to Japan to train the Imperial Army against a bunch of rogue samurai. The Imperial Army represents the new Japan (in 1876), a nation that has turned its eyes to the western world. The samurai represent the old japanese style, fighting without fire weapons, living a life of discipline, simplicity, commitment and respect for the nature, etc. <p>This clash of so different cultures is what makes this movie interesting. Besides, there are many dialogues spoken in japanese (what helps create the correct atmosphere), the costumes and figurines are excellent, and the battle scenes, that some people found to be not well-represented and slow, caught my attention every time. <p>Not only Tom Cruise is good, though a little too intense; the girl Koyuki and, especially, this amazing actor Ken Watanabe play their parts with a tremendous ease and desenvolture, giving us, westerners, a glimpse of what japanese culture is (or was). <p>OK, the script is Hollywood from beginning to end, but, nonetheless, Edward Zwick did a competent job, just like he did in another exceptional movie, \"Glory\".

This is an expression of a reality that the makers of The Last Samurai seem to be highly aware of: that &quot;progress&quot; is a relative term, and technology brings as much woe as it does improvement.<p>At the film\'s opening, ex-Civil War hero Capt. Nathan Algren (Tom Cruise) is a minion of the world of technology.  Specifically, he works for the Winchester gun company, halfheartedly promoting the high-tech repeater rifle.  One man in the crowd, noticing that Algren is clearly unfit to be a corporate performer, introduces him to Omura, a Japanese official visiting the United States.<p>In the end, he accepts a well-paying post as trainer for the Imperial Japanese army, which is engaged in keeping down a rebellion lead by Katsumoto (played with genius by Ken Watanabe), former tutor to the Emperor and leader of a small band of samurai who reject the Western improvements which the Emperor is introducing to Japan.<p>Unfortunately, the Imperial regiment is sent out prematurely, and the samurai have no difficulty scattering it.  Algren is captured and taken to a mountain hideout of the samurai, where he spends the winter as a prisoner.  He is cared for by the widow Taka (played by the arresting Koyuki -- why hasn\'t Hollywood seen more of her?) and eventually is drawn into a series of penetrating conversations with Katsumoto.  As time passes, director Zwick and his talented cast paint an absolutely enthralling picture of a society governed by discipline, tradition, and a sort of Zen stoicism that Algren begins to love.  I am no student of Japanese culture, so whether this picture is in any way accurate, I do not know.  I feel it is more important as iconography than as history, however.<p>Predictably, Algren throws in his hat with the samurai, learning Japanese and the expert use of the ever-important katana.  But then, to his secret dismay, he is given safe conduct back to Tokyo and prepares to return home.  But before the end he returns to the samurai village via some incredible swordplay, in time to take part in the final battle.  And by the way, the scene wherein he is armed by Taka in her deceased husband\'s armour, though completely chaste, is one of the most truthful and moving scenes of sensuality I have ever seen, largely due to the subtle and wordless acting of Koyuki.<p>Though the movie stars Cruise and, as many reviewers have pointed out, Watanabe ends up stealing the show, I think the underlying protagonist and antagonist of this film are cultures: on the one hand, the old, spiritual samurai culture --i.e. the soul of Japan -- and on the other hand, the efforts at modernization spearheaded by Omura and funded by America.  Since the sympathy is so clearly with the samurai, the film becomes a reactionary piece, perhaps even Luddite.  Clearly, samurai culture was not all about discipline, poetry, and spiritual meditation, nor was America just a merchant nation happy to sell instruments of death for profit.  But as I mentioned earlier, the iconography is much more important than the actual history; the point here is that what we see as progress can often kill the soul and mutilate the body, and the ways and wisodm of those who came before us should not be rejected in favor of technology.<p>This is, after all, a classic theme with plenty of resonance, so it ends up working very well and not feeling too heavy-handed.  And in the final battle, the iconography is emphasized to the point that it cannot be missed: the machine-gun comes into the forefront as the incarnation of modernity at its deadliest.  These scenes, with their slow-motion machine-gun fire and lack of sound or music, strangely reminded me of a completely displaced Road to Perdition.  Here the cinematography becomes quite stunning, and the power of the symbolism is undeniable.<p>In the end, this is a classic tale of tradition fighting against the overwhelming tide of modernity.  It correctly identifies the Good Life as something non-material, and then creates a drama out of men fighting and dying to preserve this life.  Since the film portrays classic themes and boasts a cast able to bring the themes to life with a considerable degree of success, The Last Samurai rates five stars.'),(880,33,'B0001G6PZC','Dallas Buyers Club','Excellent movie...with problems','A beautiful tale of a man finding redemtion in an unlikely plave....but the beauty of Zwicks battles and scenery are overshadowed by a typically hollywood liberla anit-American view.

The direction of Edward Zwick (\"Glory\", \"Courage Under Fire\") was top-notch and powerful! And the performance of superstar Tom Cruise (\"Minority Report\") was unforgettable! Surely one of the best Tom Cruise performances since \"Top Gun\"!<p>The film focuses on Nathan Algren (Cruise), a decorated war hero (from the war against the American Indians) now drunkenly relegated to showing off new gun technology at expositions. Algren is offered handsome compensation to leave the States and help bring Japan into the modern age of guns and to suppress a revolt of nontechnological samurai making trouble in the hinterlands. During a raid that is botched by unready troops, Algren is captured but not before managing to cleverly kill off one of the most accomplished samurai. The samurai lord, Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe), is impressed with Algren\'s magificent fighting spirit and resourcefulness and decides to nurse him back to health so that he might learn more about his enemy.<p>The premise revealed. I will skip the rest of the plot, saying only that it is inevitable that Algren comes to respect and then love the ways of his captors and becomes himself an accomplished warrior in their disciplined traditions. He soon allies himself against his former compatriots and must learn what true honor is and how both life and death can help one reach his destiny. Essentially, and I do not say this casually, this film is \"Dances with Wolves\" set among the Japanese \"other\" rather than the American \"other\".<p>The film started like a Tom Cruise movie, stopped being one for a fascinating hour or so, and then returned to its Hollywood roots. When we first see Cruise, he is doing his trademark Cruise acting: slightly over the top in his anger, drunkenness, and overall swagger. However, once Algren is abducted, we get to see some really nice stuff. Thank goodness for the strength and charisma of his co-star, Ken Watanabe as Katsumoto. Watanabe is as focused and economical an actor I have seen in some time and manages to communicate more rage, love, or concern in a steely glance than Cruise can with a monologue\'s worth of bluster.<p>It\'s great watching Algren and Katsumoto (and incidentally, Cruise and Watanabe) learn from each other and settle each other down. Cruise is at his best here when he\'s \'listening\', when someone else is driving the scene. I dare say even that he\'s better when speaking his scant lines of Japanese than those in English because it forces him most convinvingly out of his element. However, just as we come to admire Cruise\'s identification with samurai stillness and restraint (and what one can achieve with a \"good death\"), the spirit of the movie swings back across the Pacific to Hollywood again, and we have a fairly typical Cruise ending that betrays what we have come to appreciate most about \"The Last Samurai\" -- the acceptance of destiny. I won\'t spoil the end, but I will say that whether or not Algren survives the climactic battle (between sword-wielding samurai and newfangled howitzer repeating rifles) makes or breaks the point of Algren\'s spiritual conversion.<p>\"The Last Samurai\" is beautifully filmed, and like two of director Ed Zwick\'s own definitive films -- \"Courage Under Fire\" and \"Glory\" -- this one asks challenging questions about honor and country from the perspective of outsiders. In conclusion, \"The Last Samurai\" not only has two unforgettable performances by Tom Cruise and Ken Watanabe, but also a fine supporting cast including Timothy Spall, Billy Connolly, Tony Goldwyn, Koyuki, and William Atherton. \"The Last Samurai\" is a definite DVD must-have when it\'s released!'),(882,33,'B0001G6PZC','Dallas Buyers Club','Ego trip','The sheer arrogance of this films is mind blowing. First of all, the thought that the Emperor of Japan needed the wisdom of an American to set things right in his kingdom is absurd. Secondly, aren\'t we all getting a little tired of Tom Cruise presenting himself as some sort of super man in his movies?  He, like Mel Gibson, has  often cast himself as characters whose bravery and martial skills are of almost mythic proportions.  Additionally, these heroes are frequently disillusioned, bitter men, who, through an orgy of blood and guts discover themselves and learn to love.<p>Folks, this is cookie cutter scripting. Those moments in this film where we are treated to shots of Cruise looking into the distance, steely eyed and noble are embarrassing. Is this really how Cruise thinks of himself? Is he so hot and so wonderful that the wife of the man he killed can\'t keep her hands off of him? This is one of many movies made over the years where a white man saves a picturesque but flawed culture. This is Eurocentric cultural insensitivity at its worst.<p>The script is a series of cliches superimposed on  19th century Japan. Sadly the story could very well be transfered to any other culture with a little tweak here and there.

Their attitude goes beyond carelessness or artistic reinterpretation to downright contempt for reality.<br /><br />Essentially, \"The Last Samurai\" is pure fantasy that pretends to be historical.  Of course, there\'s nothing wrong with fantasy -- unless it tries to pass itself off as reality.  In reality, the 25,000-strong rebel army fought with modern weapons and tactics.  Indeed, their first actions were to raid government armories and steal as many guns and as much ammunition as they could, which didn\'t turn out to be enough.  Zwick\'s vision of sword-swinging, armor-wearing samurai is as absurd as having the Battle of Gettysburg fought out between lance-wielding knights in shining armor.  It would look pretty cool but be impossible to take seriously.<br /><br />Perhaps this historical fantasy is the reason the film quite explicitly backs what was by any reasonable standard the wrong side in Japan\'s struggle over modernization.  It\'s odd, isn\'t it, that a film from a country that takes such pride in freedom and democracy should glorify an oppressive, xenophobic, militaristic, medieval caste system and demonize the people and forces that brought Japan such modern plagues as as political equality and universal education.  Indeed, Watanabe\'s character was the first to call for Japan to invade Korea and expand its Empire onto the Asian mainland, and the government\'s refusal to do so played a large part in his decision to join the rebels.<br /><br />\"The Last Samurai\", although it pretends to be historical, does its best to avoid unpleasant historical reality by focusing on an idealized myth of samurai bravery, dedication and willingness to die for their traditional (and fictional) way of life.  It does the same thing for premodern Japan as \"Gone with the Wind\" does for the slaveholding South -- invents an idyllic past and covers up all the unpleasant bits that might make one question the value of slavery or feudalism.<br /><br />An odd thought struck me while watching the final glorious kamikaze charge: are the heroes of this film so different from the reactionary extremists of the modern day?  Will Hollywood in a few decades be putting out a film celebrating the bravery, dedication and traditional virtues of, say, the Taliban?  I would have immediately dismissed such thoughts as absurd before seeing \"The Last Samurai\".  Now, however, I cannot be so certain.'),(884,34,'B0001G6PZC','Dallas Buyers Club','The Last Samurai - An exceptional epic film!','As epic movies go, &quot;The Last Samurai&quot; is a superb one despite any historical inaccuracies which is what the History Channel is for.  All of the big named male actors such as Mel Gibson and Russell Crowe had their epic war movies and Tom Cruise was sorely due for one and in this movie he chose very well.  Over the years, like many super stars, Tom Cruise has chosen some extremely good roles and at the other end of the spectrum he\'s done some very poor movies but with &quot;The Last Samurai,&quot; the part couldn\'t have been better for him as it was supremely suited to his talents.<p>Along with the superior performance given by Tom Cruise, his co-actors in Timothy Spall, Ken Watanabe, Billy Connolly, Tony Goldwyn, Hiroyuki Sanada and Koyuki and so many others added greatly to the overall feel of the movie through their performances which were all of great depth and feeling.<p>Over the years, Edward Zwick has directed some of the finest movies to ever grace the silver screen such as &quot;Glory&quot; and &quot;Legends of the Fall&quot; and &quot;The Last Samurai&quot; serves well to his legacy by being added to his library of exceptional films.  Additional credit goes to Hans Zimmer for the score for this outstanding film.<p>The Premise:<p>Civil War hero Captain Nathan Algren (Tom Cruise) has seen all too well the horrors of war and the policies of the American government in both dealing with soldiers of the south and especially Native Americans.  He is essentially forced into going to Japan to fight for the government against the Samurai that have for so long defended Japan but are now anachronistic in their eyes.  In a twist of fate, he is forced to lead his forces against the Samurai before they are ready and his forces are easily routed and he is captured.<p>Feeling merciful and wanting to learn more about his new enemy, Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe) spares his life and takes him to his village for the winter.  Captain Algren spends that time there and suddenly finds a rebirth...<p>What follows from there is an exceptional film both in its touching and intriguing story and the extraordinary battle scenes.

It\'s beautifully shot, wonderfully acted, full of humor, poetry and sensuality and considering the fact that it is of course A MOVIE (for those of you overly concerned with real looking sets, etc), I was mesmerized and entertained for the 2 plus hours I was watching this great movie.

There will always be the inevitable haters and those comparing it to Dances With Wolves, etc, but disregard those folks and go see what is sure to be an Oscar Winner. You won\'t be disappointed.'),(886,34,'B0001G6PZC','Dallas Buyers Club','Cliche Story and a Stupid Historical Point of View','I wish that you could divide the rating system -- have one set of ratings for the story and another for the message.<br /><br />If this movie were about a fictional man from a fictional place learning about a different culture and finding a new sense of honor in himself, the movie would merit three stars based on the production values, the star power, and the entertainment value of exotic locales, battle scenes, redemption scenes, etc.(the downsides -- the plot is predictable and there is no real depth to the characters)<br /><br />But this movie disturbed me, perhaps because I had just read a history of Japan, and because it continued this Hollywood self-hatred of America theme that keeps rearing its ugly head.<br /><br />To view the movie, you would never know that Japan was struggling to overthrow a decadent and stifling shogunate that had basically kept the country back in the Middle Ages.  Farmers weren\'t allowed to leave their villages.  Samurai weren\'t allowed to go into business.  Until Perry came, foreigners were restricted access to one trading post.  While the backlash to Perry triggered a wave of ostrich-like denial of technology and the west, a very smart clique of leaders soon realized that the Japanese themselves had to take the lead in modernizing their country.  The samurai who didn\'t get it, would have made their country more vulnerable to the west by being more backward, if they had had their way.<br /><br />So the ending is completely wrong, if you are pro-Japanese.  Yes, they chafed under unequal trade treaties, but the future safety of the country was not to go backwards...and they didn\'t, so unlike China, the Japanese were able to recoup their sovereignty and engage the West on increasingly equal (and if you were Russian in 1905) superior footing.<br /><br />The ending is also completely wrong if you are pro-American.  The character played by Tom Cruise loathes his country as much as he loathes himself.  Americans were not saints during the 1860s or in any era, but there were plenty of heroes, and it\'s a tiresome choice to continue this stock theme of self-flagellation so rampant in movies like Dances with Wolves (which this story really rips off -- I\'m sure that\'s how they pitched it -- \"its Dances with Wolves, but set in Japan\").<br /><br />I bet that the movie would have done much better if the Cruise character had been more noble in the U.S. and if the ending could have been about some kind of reconciliation, instead of the divisive travesty that they decided to show.<br /><br />At some point, one of the Hollywood studios is going to wake up and realize that Americans like to see positive, heroic portrayals from time to time instead of the diseased anti-heroes that they keep foisting on us, and whichever studio gets this will clean up at the box office.<br /><br />If you are into Japan see one of Kurosawa\'s films.  If you are into east-west stories, read Shogun or Tai-Pan.  If it\'s movie night, and you\'ve seen everything else, this will do for entertainment, but take it for a piece of fiction, don\'t take its pretensions seriously.'),(887,34,'B0001G6PZC','Dallas Buyers Club','Captain America Undergoes Japanese Spiritual Transplant','There are some films that are so obvious and heavy-handed in their political correctness that even if one agrees with the sentiments expressed, one must hold ones nose to do so. \"The Last Samurai\" is a fine example of regard for another culture taken to such a superficial extreme that the result is smelly cardboard.<br /><br />I suppose that a big budget film starring one of Hollywood\'s most self-important egos must adhere to the ugly-American-meets-epiphany-and-goes-native formula, but will one of these unctuous tomes please depart from formula long enough to at least follow through on its own logic?<br /><br />This film is hypocritical in avowing its respect for Japanese culture. At least Kevin Costner created a coherent world in \"Dances With Wolves\". His Union soldier was largely an observer of the events of his time, and when he eventually left the Sioux nation, he had not single-handedly saved them from destruction or awakened them to their ancestral precepts. In \"The Last Samurai\", not only does the white hero receive an oriental spiritual transplant; he actually becomes the saviour of Japan. C\'mon--gimme a break.<br /><br />The Meiji Emperor was not a timid little weakling just waiting for the redeemed American to give him backbone and remind him of the wisdom residing within his own culture. And even if we were to suspend all disbelief and accept that the last surviving soldier on a particularly horrific battlefield should turn out to be our unlikely hero, it surpasses even the crudest naivety that the adversaries he has just decimated would throw down their arms and pay homage to him as the last samurai. That scene left a foul taste in my mouth.<br /><br />Had this film truly honoured Japanese culture with the respect it professes to feel, the white hero would have died or at least turned out to be less than God\'s gift to Japan. Even Lawrence of Arabia ultimately failed to create his Pan-Arab nation, and that film could teach this one a lesson or two in how sensitively such themes need to be handled.<br /><br />This film is not an abject failure. The performances by Ken Watanabe and Hiroyuki Sanada are superb and they do wonders within its shallow arc. Even Tom Cruise puts aside his most egregious excesses and serves up a passably sympathetic character. But even good performances cannot save this film from the consequences of its presumption. This is a do-gooder film that will go down well with historical revisionists and Champagne liberals who simply have to feel bad about the imperialist bits in America\'s past while congratulating themselves on how enlightened they are. For the rest of us, the falseness at the heart of this movie makes it impossible to enjoy it at anything but the most superficial level.'),(888,34,'B0001G6PZC','Dallas Buyers Club','We have to let people change all by themselves','After the opening of Japan in 1853 under the pressure of the US and their Perry expedition, and the restoration of Imperial power in 1867, things went very fast. Japan was modernized at first to the best profit of the USA. But this development brought strong resistance within Japan from the feudal order of the Samourais, and a very agressive expansion on the Asian continent. This film concentrates on the final push against feudalism and its old code of honor represented by the Samourais. This change was particularly brutal with imported weapons from the USA, an exclusive contract, and military counsellors. The move was led by some big capitalist families who were ruthless about the change and who violently eradicated all opposition to the final death of it and them. The film shows this very well. The character Tom Cruise embodies here is probably fictitious but it links the wars against the Indians in the US to this war against mountain tribes and villages in Japan. The same objective : to impose industrial development in an extremely egotistic way : no honor, no real democracy, no concertation. Just change, and profits for a few. The film is short on one issue : this forced change led the new industrial aristocracy to an expansion that was carried out through war and the use of brutal force. Japan needed new markets and new workers. They found them in Formosa, in China, in Manchuria, in Korea, and they even tried to conquer Siberia. We know what that process led to forty years later. We should never force foreign countries to change too fast and along a ruthless profit-minded road because profit knows no obstacles, and frustration leads to a need for historical compensation, and sooner or later the two come together. Any country should have the right to change at its own rhythm and along its own logic.<p>Dr Jacques COULARDEAU'),(889,34,'B0001G6PZC','Dallas Buyers Club','beautiful but misleading & historically inaccurate','As other reviewers have said, this film has gorgeous scenery and remarkable attention to visual historical detail such as costume and architecture. Unfortunately, the approach to the cultural history of Japan is far from accurate and in some ways derogatory. It reminds me of the sort of 19th century \"noble savage\" romanticism that today is universally recognized as patronizing and racist.<br /><br />Anyone who knows anything about the history of Japan knows that the samurai were essentially feudal warlords. Each leading samurai controlled his own territory, and his subjects paid tribute in exchange for safety. The samurai battled endlessly (and bloodily) with each other, in a thousand-year struggle for supremacy and dominance. The so-called \"honor\" of their militant mentality was accompanied by a culture that demanded, among other things, that the wife of a defeated samurai should commit suicide rather than live with the \"shame\" of her defeated husband. The emporer at that time was nothing more than the samurai who managed to become the most powerful and convinced a number of other samurai to serve him (as apparently the lead character was one) ... what the film omits is that before the emporer ended up in a war with his own samurai, he and his fathers had waged a several-century war against all the other samurai, engaging in wholesale slaughter and subjugation of all the other groups. Furthermore, what occurred in the period immediately following the period portrayed in the film is even more telling: once the emporer had dispatched the last of his potential rivals, he created a personal cult around himself and his descendants coupled with a japanese nationalism that eventually lead to the Japanese imperial expansion that brutally occupied much of Asia prior to World War Two (and which America and our allies Britain and Australia expended many lives and much treasure to defeat).<br /><br />Historically speaking, I don\'t believe that any of these groups were necessarily something to look up to or find \"noble\"... in reality, all sides in this battle were equally vicious and power-hungry. Portraying them as such is misleading and wrong, and does an injustice to those Japanese now who know that their history was anything but this ridiculously romanticized claptrap.<br /><br />In addition, the historical distortions seem designed to leave one with a moral lesson that is both misguided and disturbing. As another reviewer wrote:<br /><br />What is the moral narrative of this story? Industry bad, nature good? Those who follow ancient practices good, modern science bad? But modern weapons win and the honor of fighting is lost.<br /><br />If the film had accurately portrayed the history of the samurai and the rise of the emporer as I described above, could anyone possibly reach this conclusion?

The Last Samurai is a powerful tale that stays with you. I can\'t get enough of this modern masterpice.<br /><br />Capt. Nathan Algren(Cruise) is an Army veteran. He\'s become an alcholic and hates himself and frequently has flashbacks over some of the Indians he\'s killed. He\'s falling apart and things don\'t look great for him until he\'s offered a job by the ambassador of Japan Umura(Hamada).<br /><br />The Emperor of Japan is modernizing the country and doing it very quickly. The Emperors former advisor Katsumota(Watanabe) doesn\'t like the old ways and is doing everything in his power to delay them. He is one of the greatest Samurai to ever live and is well respected and loved by his people. Umura nows Japan can\'t beat him so he convinces the Emperor that they must modernize so they can defeat Katsumoto.<br /><br />Algren comes to Japan reluctantly. He hates Col. Bagley(Goldwyn) who is his superior officer in the operation. He\'s trying to train the Japanese men as fast as he can, but they don\'t have a enough time. Umura and Bagley order Algren to takes his men into battle against Katsumoto agains his will.<br /><br />The fight between the armies is quick and very bloody. Katsumoto captures Algren after seeing the passion and fire in his eyes during battle. They take Algren back to their village for winter so Katsumoto can get to learn his enemy better.<br /><br />Algren is treated fairly well by the people. They help him overcome his alcholism battle. He hates the place at first, but as he lives there and sees the discipline of the Samurai people he begins to accept and love their culture. He becomes friends with Katsumoto and gains respect from most of the village. Winter ends though and he must return to Tokyo.<br /><br />Upon his return to Tokyo he sees the advance of the Japanese army. Umora has increased the spending of Japan in their arms and it\'s obvious he has lots of influence over the emperor. Umora is determined to kill the Samurai and Katsumoto. After a scuffle in Tokyo Algren returns with the Samurai to help prepare them in their last stand against the Japanese army.<br /><br />The acting is phenomenal in this movie. Tom Cruise and Ken Watanabe are amazing in their roles as Algren and Katsumoto. Cruise plays the role with passion and intensity. He does a great job displaying the change that Algren takes emotionaly and physically. He really did get cheated by not getting an Oscar nomination. This guy has done a lot for the movie industry and the academy but they continue to not pay him back. Cruise almost didn\'t do this movie because of his commitment to Cold Mountain. They didn\'t give the money he wanted so he became The Last Samurai.<br /><br /> Ken Watanabe really shines in this picture. He isn\'t intimidated by Cruise at all and is equal if not better to him. He becomes Katsumoto and is amazing. He\'s funny, brave, charming, and smart all at the same time. He deserved the Oscar nomination he received and probaly should have won it. I\'m excited about seeing Ken in the new Batman movie. This guy is great.<br /><br />Edward Zwick really does a great job with this movie. The Last Samurai is produced by Cruises production company and they were the only man they wanted to direct this. Zwick has plenty of experience in this area of movies with Glory on his resume. He shots this movie well and it\'s all done in tastes. The fight scenes are shot especially well. The camera angles are great and we really get a good idea of how the Samurai fought. The violence isn\'t over done and you see the art that is sword play. Zwick has made a masterpiece.<br /><br />A lot of people have bashed the ending of the movie. They think it\'s sappy and to happy. It\'s anything but that. If you pay attention to the movie and realize that Algren didn\'t fail his mission he has no shame. Algren loved Katsumoto and so did the Emperor so thats why we have that scene at the ending of the well. I found it to be a powerful ending to a dynamic film.<br /><br />This is a great movie. It\'s so well made and attention is paid in it to the tiniest details. This movie will stay with you for days and all the good dramas do. If you like dramas or war films than you must see this film.

This disc collection has got them all.  It\'s wonderful to note that some of Japanese actors and actresses in the movie played a significant role by assisting the Director, Zwick in understanding the protocols and behaviours of the past when Samurais roamed Japan.  There\'s a tremendous respect between the Japanese and the production crew as they assisted one another in bridging the cultural gap &amp; enhancing one another\'s performances.  I am disappointed to read about people\'s comparison of this movie with Dances With Wolves.  If people\'s tendency is to compare this movie with that and so forth, movie industry would have come to a close long time ago as why should people cough out money to watch a movie that is almost identical to the movie that they watched before?  I have enormous respect for Tom Cruise as he\'s a focused and dedicated actor.  Moreover, he\'s almost universally known as a generous actor too.  Whilst Tom was shooting in New Zealand location, he had interacted with the local community by calling a local radio station &amp; donating resources to charity.  That\'s what I call star quality.  Anyhow, this movie is very well-done as the production crew took the best element from their location shots particularly in those old shrines in Himeji &amp; Kyoto, Japan; New Zealand.  Japanese cast is superb namely Ken Watanabe who lost out on Oscar\'s Best Supporting Actor Award.  He definitely lifted this movie to another level by giving it a much needed weight, presence, &amp; charisma and no wonder his samurais followed him to the shadow of death as long as honour is restored.  The documentary about samurais in the second disc is very informative.  It wanted the viewers to decide for themselves if this movie is pure Hollywood or historical fact.  At the end of the day, it\'s a bit of both.  The anchor said it well that in real life, the samurais would be considered the renegade, the dinasours that refused to give in to the fact that their time had passed and that they refused to move on with time.  They were supposed to be the &quot;baddies&quot; in the movie as they fought against the Government which would like to implement change for the betterment of Japanese society.  Moreover, what about the caste system that they implemented in their own village?  As I was in Japan, I always wondered if the change that the Government enforced is necessarily better for its society?  I also wondered how practical it would be should samurais are still roaming Japan and every time they step into the railway station, all people would kneel down and avoiding eye contact and they would cut the innocents if they get in their ways somehow?  In some ways, I miss Japan of the old as any industrial cities nowadays look almost similar to each other.  Still, we have to come to terms that time changes everything.

The main story is a reverent account of the character of the Japanese people and the Samurai in particular, but there\'s much more to it than simply that.  The film has many subplots and resolves them all neatly without ever seeming contrived.  Everything from Algren\'s (Tom Cruise) search for peace to his understated yet elegant love story with Taka (Koyuki) is handled as well as it conceivably could be.  Writer John Logan avoids the overwrought melodrama that burdens most war movies; everything is as quietly graceful as the Samurai way of living depicted within the film.<p>The acting is, on every front, excellent.  Tom Cruise gives an uncharacteristically melancholy performance as Captain Nathan Algren, while Ken Watanabe perfectly encapsulates the quiet honor of Samurai leader Katsumoto.  The actors cast in the supporting roles are equally suited to the film, each giving realistic and powerful performances by turns.<p>Director Edward Zwick infuses the entire film with the necessary serene feel.  He uses well-placed camera angles to complement and enhance the already magnificent sets, and even cliched choices (such as Algren\'s choppy, blurred memories) are handled competently.  The only area that Zwick falls a little short in is in his directing of the action.  Despite the R rating of the film, he displays a timidity in his direction which, at times, makes it blatantly obvious that these are stunts.  Even still, this movie is not an action film, and it\'s appropriate that Zwick kept it from becoming a visceral bloodbath.  This isn\'t too say that there aren\'t graphic depictions of violence, but Zwick generally avoids the blatant displays which fill movies like &quot;Kill Bill&quot;, preferring to quickly cut away from gory moments.<p>If &quot;The Last Samurai&quot; has a real problem, it\'s that the story is about somewhat immaterial concepts: tradition, honor, and the character of a culture.  It can be difficult to emotionally connect with things of such abstract nature, but even still, it\'s as elegant a defense of such things as the moviegoer is likely to find.  And the stories of the characters and their relationships within this defense are powerful enough to provide more than enough emotional resonance to compensate.<p>In a year that saw the release of many excellent films, &quot;The Last Samurai&quot; is among the best.

That being said, I have enjoyed many of his films and look forward to many more.  I think he did a wonderful performance in this picture, however, even if he weren\'t in the picture, it could have stood on its own.  Ken Watanabe is a superb actor, not to mention a very sexy man who played Katsumoto.  Other actors of note include: Hiroyuki Sanada who played Ujio and might I add another hunk of burning love; Shin Koyamada, who played Nobutada, Katsumto\'s son and Tom Cruise\'s first Japanese friend and Maisha Khan, who played Taka, Katsumto\'s widowed sister and mother of two young boys and Tom Cruise\'s love interest.

The preparation is needed to stop a rebellion of Samurai warriors led by Katsumoto [played by Ken Watanabe] who have been attacking railroads and supply trains.<br /><br />After being sent to the front lines with troops he believes aren\'t ready to fight yet, Algren is captured after a battle and is brought to the village of Katsumoto\'s brother in the mountains. Despite some harsh attempts of getting used to the lifestyle of the Samurai, Algren slowly but surely learns how to love the Samurai lifestyle and how they work day and night.<br /><br />The movie shows us breath taking landscape shots of the mountains the Samurai live in. It even shows some great rain storm scenes as Algren attempts to prove himself by battling in a swordfight with one of the experienced Samurai and refuses to stay down no matter how many times he is knocked down.<br /><br />This movie also comes with some great fighting style scenes. With the fog war near the beginning in which Algren is captured after his inexperience troops are cut down by the Samurai, to a Ninja attack on the Samurai village where the samurai sacrifice themselves to save Katsumoto, to even Algren siding with Katsumoto for the climactic battle in the end against his fellow officers.<br /><br />This movie is great in so many ways: The vibrant color of the scenery, the style of fighting is smooth yet terrifying as lots of men die, and even the dialogue between Algren and Katsumoto is great as they have their \"Many Conversations.\"<br /><br />I reccomend this movie if you really want to see a story of a man who realizes what he really wants for himself in this world.........'),(915,39,'B0001G6PZC','Dallas Buyers Club','Corny ending-fairly good movie','I think it\'s fair to assume that the majority of Tom Cruise\'s fans aren\'t particularly interested in Samurai movies--and the majority of Samurai movie fans aren\'t too interested in Tom Cruise.

To my surprise-his performance was credible--though there are a few absurd moments-such as an early battle scene where Cruise is fighting off a half dozen or so Samurai single handed (though he does get wounded)  As someone who\'s lived in Japam twice--I was also amazed by how easily Cruise\'s character picked up Japanese!<br /><br />Nit picking aside-I enjoyed this movie--except for the ending which was about as lame as anything imaginable.

If it had ended here-I would have rated the move 4 stars--but the \"epilogue\" was a disaster!

Algren takes on this task for money and no other reason, he does not care about anything or anyone, death is no longer something he fears and it is partly this lack of fear that saves his life when he is captured by the `enemy,\' who take him to their camp and inadvertently bring him spiritually closer to the way of the Samurai.<br /><br />Algren slowly falls under the spell of the Samurai Code of Honour and he eventually switches his allegiance in battle, ending up fighting with the Samurai against the people he was brought over to train.<br /><br />He forges a tenuous relationship with Taka, the widow of the man he killed in battle, and becomes a father figure to her two young sons and wins the grudging respect of the Samurai sword trainer who tries to break his spirit and his bones.<br /><br />The film does to a certain extent become a study in redemption as Algren strives to find his place in the scheme of things and to erase the guilt of his dishonourable past actions.  Eventually though Algren comes to realise he cannot erase the past, he can either live with it or let it crush him.<br /><br />He chooses to live but only as a Samurai, and that could mean his death at any given moment.<br /><br />The whole film was a vibrant, violent, passionate look into a past that Japan has never been able to reclaim since the days of the Samurai.  With the western world on the doorstep trying to force their way in, Japan had to let go of some of her ancient traditions to survive and in doing so lost a big part of herself.<br /><br />The Last Samurai has been accused of being too much on the side of the Samurai, but I think it manages to find a kind of balance, with both good and bad on both sides, and the over all film certainly deserves the five stars I am giving it.<br /><br />Cruise does well not to fluff the Japanese language too much in the movie, I liked that they used subtitles, it gave the movie considerable authenticity, and the fight scenes as gory as they were, were breathtaking to watch, along with a fabulous musical score and scenery that I can\'t even do justice to in this critique.<br /><br />A movie I will be watching again I think, because you cannot honestly take everything in, in just one viewing.<br /><br />By far one of the best movies to come out of 2003 in my opinion.'),(917,39,'B0001G6PZC','Dallas Buyers Club','six of one','The basic idea for this film was original, juxtaposing the two very different cultures of 19th century American soldiers and Samurai warriors.  The acting was better than I expected.  Tom Cruise is a much better actor than many of his big budget action flicks would suggest; on the all too rare occassion that he takes on an interesting script, his performances are quite impressive (e.g. Born on the Fourth of July, Interview with a Vampire).  To some extent, this film is an attempt to mix the traditional action-Cruise with the more intense and inwardly tortured character seen in his better works.  And as a result the film left me with somewhat mixed impressions.  Certainly the film has its moments; there are scenes that are beautifully shot and choreographed.  Unfortunately, however, other scenes are so absurdly unrealistic (I\'m sorry, no amount of warrior ethos can begin to match the withering blast of a gatling gun) that I was left feeling a bit flat with the result.'),(918,39,'B0001G6PZC','Dallas Buyers Club','Interesting, pretty to look at, I needed more from it','I missed seeing The Last Samurai in the theatre but decided to buy a copy anyway because it looked good in the ads and the write-ups I\'d read.<br /><br />Tom Cruise plays the role of Captain Nathan Algren, former Indian fighter in the U.S. Army (bits of this are shown in flashbacks)now a pathetic drunken loser reduced to giving sales demonstrations of Winchester rifles.<br /><br />He\'s contacted by a former associate and takes on the job of instructing the newly formed Japanese Imperial Army. The story is set in 1876 or so at a time of great change in Japan, the forces of modernization fast pacing Japan into the modern age. Part of this mission involves rooting out the last Samurai holdouts. Algren leads his recruits into battle, his recruits are massacred and after a valiant fight he is captured by the very man he is supposed to deal with. Taken to the Samurai village as a prisoner Algren gradually learns their ways, even learns to respect them. Algren eventually, after failing to reintegrate with his own people (and the dishonorable Japanese modernizers who I wanted to see get killed),joins with the Samurai in a battle to the death with the new Imperial Army. This is of course a slaughter with swords & spears against rifles & Gatling guns. The Imperial soldiers are so shamed by what they\'ve done that they refuse an order to kill Algren and the Emperor strips the chief \"New Japan\" leader of everything he has.<br /><br />You never really learn what happens to Algren, it seems he goes back to the stronghold and the lead Samurai\'s widow, but that is presented as maybe he did, who knows?<br /><br />I thought the story was interesting, Cruise did a good job, but something was lacking- I\'m not sure what. The costumes/ weapons were great, most of the sets/ locations were too ( a real sense of being in Japan)I just needed something more. Some of the extras are very interesting, I liked learning about how things were built or designed. The section about the film\'s Premiere in Japan was alright with the Japanese cast giving their thought\'s about the show although I thought the \" I like Tom Cruise\" stuff was a little to strong,the History Channel mini-documentary was too Cruise-ey for my taste as well.'),(919,39,'B0001G6PZC','Dallas Buyers Club','In a word, WOW!','In a word, WOW! This has got to be one of the best films I have ever seen in this genre. The story is post-Civil War where a lot of the war heroes were unemployed and out of place. Tom Cruise, one of those war heroes who becomes disenchanted with the war and flees to a bottle, is contacted by war buddies and signs on to train an army for Japan to wipe out the samurai. Although he feels his new command is unable to fight, his superiors put the troops to the combat test. As they fail, Cruise is captured and taken captive by the samurai. Without giving the entire plot away, the scenery, locations, and acting were top notch. It is the old ways vs. the new ways and it seems for awhile that the new ways are better.

After that, I don\'t have much to say favorably.  I\'m not an expert on early modern Japanese history, but as a journeyman I know enough to say with confidence that the story here is preposterous.  The Japanese looked to Germany (Prussia), not the US for army training.  Emporer Meiji, the greatest of their modern monarchs was a strong and decisive ruler (and wasn\'t referred to as Meiji until after his death, just as Hirohito is now referred to as Shoa).  The dramatizations and interplay of the characters, however, is what was really preposterous.  It may make for decent drama, but this is the sort of film that leads to typical American ignorance about foreign countries and their histories.  Anyone sincerely curious about this era in Japan might well read James Clavell\'s imperfect, but vastly better, Gai Jin or, better yet, Lafcadio Hearn\'s memoirs which point out that it was virtually impossible for a westerner to assimilate in late Nineteenth Century Japan.  The producers of this film ought to be profoundly ashamed of themselves over this script which is nearly as bad as the despicably similar Bushido Blade of about 20 years ago.  This doesn\'t mean that one shouldn\'t see this, only that it ought not to be taken seriously.'),(921,40,'B0001G6PZC','Dallas Buyers Club','A strong film . . . with a recycled storyline','As others have pointed out, the storyline here mirrors Dances with Wolves.  So much so that it\'s a little hard to give the rest of the movie credit for the original parts it does well.  But taken on its own, I feel it merits four stars.<p>I generally like Tom Cruise\'s movies, so I didn\'t have a problem watching him in this role.  Cruise is a talented actor, although he basically plays every part the same way, so he offers nothing terribly new here.  Still, he turns in a fine--if somewhat typical--performance.<p>The other actors in this movie were well cast.  Much has been made about Ken Watanabe\'s performance.  I thought it was strong but disagree with others who felt he overshadowed Cruise and everyone else.  Those who were seduced by this romanticized portrayal of Samurai culture were probably left more inclined to gush over his performance.  <p>Along those lines--in the special features of this DVD, there was an interesting comment made by a military historian.  He rightly pointed out that the Samurai were, in essence, the \'bad guys\' in this conflict.  They were fighting for a caste system that did not respect women\'s rights or democratic ideals.  While such a lifestyle may be beautiful to view on the screen, living it is a different matter entirely.  There is much to admire about that culture, but there is much to detest, as well.<p>[Warning: SPOILERS in next paragraph]<p>Apparently, some found the ending to be &quot;maudlin,&quot; but unless you felt the same about movies like Braveheart or Last of the Mohicans, I doubt you\'ll agree.  Yes, it\'s typical Hollywood fare, but no adjective approaching &quot;maudlin&quot; came to mind.  Overall, I felt it was a dramatic and appropriate ending in keeping with some earlier themes (not to mention the title of the film).  My one complaint about the ending was the poor battlefield tactics used by the Samurai.  Cruise already knew the Imperial troops had Howitzers and gattling guns, yet the Samurai made no effort to address those threats in the battle (a detachment of cavalry could have swung around and attacked their flank to neutralize them).  This costly mistake was inconsistent with the earlier portrayal of Cruise\'s character as being skilled in the art of modern warfare.  <p>All in all, this is an entertaining film with some nice cinematography and exciting action sequences.

When we see a Tom Cruise film, he is usually the center of the film and always a larger than life character.  It\'s hard to feel for him or relate to him.  Here he is portrayed more human, there is more feeling and he is not quite as self-centered in his performance, not as cocky.  The cinematography is beautiful and the story is captivating.

The love affair with Cruise and Taka is sweet but with Blackthorne and Mariko it was detailed, passionate, forbidden and conspiratorial.<p>Likewise, the transition that Cruise makes into Japanese society is in fact, believable however it seems to happen swiftly. Too swiftly to remain completely credible. The script and Cruise\'s voiceover explains his love of the discipline and simplicity, which interestingly enough is what seduces Blackthorne. Well. Really seduces Blackthorne. But then again, it is Nathan that/who becomes a true warrior, and I must again give kudos to Cruise who appears believable in the great physicality of the Bushido spirit and the battle scenes.<p>All in all a nice ride, sufficient enough to take it out of the \'manly men doing manly things\' genre and allow you to think.<p>Ken Wanatabe as Katsumoto is excellent and should have won him a best supporting.

But the heart of this movie comes down to the interplay between Tom Cruise\'s character and the samurai he has befriended.  The wonderful interplay by the characters is backed up by the stark realization that, despite the two cultures (American and Japanese) being very different, they also share many things in common.<p>If all you\'re looking for is big budget blood and guts there are probably better options out there.

Wait, am I talking about a Tom Cruise movie? Why yes! And what a refreshing, vibrant, and even spiritual film this is. Through the movie\'s somewhat formulaic plot of the washed-up war hero with skeletons in the closet coming to learn the way of the samurai is a movie done truly in a classic Hollywood fashion. John Toll\'s cinematography is tear-inducingly brilliant in every frame, Hanz Zimmer\'s lush score proves haunting, and even Mr. Cruise creates a stunning, believable character arc as Nathan Algren, imprisoned by his samurai enemies, but eventually in love with the beauty and the legend of the art. There were elements of the film I wanted to dislike: Algren\'s voice-over narration that slides occasionally into cliche, the film\'s Hollywood ending, and a third act that begins to test patience. But Samurai is such an immensely satisfying experience (especially in its quaint, beautiful midsection where Algren comes to accept his destiny as a warrior) that those things become mere quibbles along the way. I can\'t say that Samurai is a masterpiece on par with even the slightest of the great samurai films, but it evokes a fondness for filmmaking to which I wish more filmmakers, like Zwick, would return more often. It\'s long, it\'s epic, it\'s a tear-jerker, and the battle scenes are so alive you have to blink twice. Call me a sucker for loving this beautiful, flawed movie, but try to resist it yourself.

Should we compare the US army in the 1870\'s to Nazi\'s? <p>Is this movie history? I think so.  Not because of the events as depicted in the movie, but for an attempt to capture a people\'s values at some point of time. It was closer to bringing that viewpoint to life than even Kurosawa\'s epics which were influenced heavily by Shakesphere and other western themes. We forget that the stories of King Arthur are very large fabrications of the West\'s transition point to from the time of the ancients to middle ages, that the knights virtues in writing were pure but in reality they were brutal instead of kind. <p>That is the point of movies, to inspire and build up our view of humanity while being careful not to extoll to heavilly the  villains. Tom Cruise\'s redemption after massacring Indians is one point of the film. How he finds peace and honor is another. How a society of traditional values finds itself eclipsed by the modern values of greed are clearly evident themes in both modern Japan and the US (whether it is true or not is not the point).  Can something in the Samurai spirit of the film be used to inspire us? Or must we only see this in films about hobbits and dwarfs (partially inspired by the horrors that Tolkein saw in WWI? <p>Technically the sword tactics were very well done and remain one of the few films that captures kenjutsu correctly. Cruise worked his tail off to make it credible and despite the time it would really would take to do so, it was still done well. <p>The filming in Japan was fantastic. The Meiji period where foreigners saw Japan as another China full of savages to be conquered is captured quite well. The Emperor who found himself in a position he was not prepared to handle with advisorsthat took advantage of him is also quite well captured. The leader of the Samurai was also well liked by the common people (then named a street after him shortly after he died) may not be the exact historical replica of the man but most of the Samurai following were \"pissed\" at loosing their swords and topknots which represented critical parts of their heritage, not about attacking Korea.<p>So the question is...do we want a documentary or a movie to inspire us?'),(932,41,'B0001G6PZC','Dallas Buyers Club','A noble cinematic experience...','Nathan Algren (Tom Cruise), an ex-Army Captain, served in the Civil War and several battles against the Native Americans.

Ever since I heard it was being made. There were those people saying \"Tom Cruise as a samurai?\" which was followed by laughter. Myself, I was optimistic. Who though Mel Gibson could play William Wallace? I actually didn\'t see it till later in its theatrical run. I was, as many others were, engrossed by The Return of the King. But I eventually saw it and again as I watch it on DVD I can\'t help but love this movie. It is rare we see a Hollywood movie focus on Japanese culture. Everything Hollywood puts out on Asian culture is of course, martial arts. <p> Tom Cruise starts as Nathan Algren. A decorated civil war hero, who, as most war veterans will say, is haunted by his past. He is hired by one of the Emperors advisors (Harada) to train the military of Japan in modern warfare. Along for the ride is Zebulan Gant (Connolly) and Colonel Bagley (Goldwyn), a previous superior who Algren detests. Shortly after Algren begins training the men, an incident forces Bagley to send the unprepared troops off to battle. They, of course, lose to the samurai led by Katsumoto (Watanabe) and Algren is captured. As he is being held at the village of the Samurai he learns their ways and befriend Katsumoto. As promised when winter ends Katsumoto returns Algren where he must make the choice to go home or join the samurai and defend what he has come to love.<p> Tom Cruise is one of those actors whose good looks overshadow his acting ability. By that I mean that a lot of people don\'t think he is a talented actor because all the women love him. Group him in with actors like Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio. All three are talented actors, and Cruise shows it with this movie. While his performance here isn\'t on par with films such as Magnolia and Jerry Maguire, he still gives a powerful performance. He is upstaged though by Ken Watanabe as the Samurai leader. Watanabe brilliantly captures the essence of a samurai warrior. You really want this guy to win, although you know he can\'t. The ending is something that will bring tears to many people\'s eyes. The supporting cast doesn\'t get the same time or emphasis but they pull it off well. We didn\'t get to see enough of Billy Connolly, but he was good. I really enjoyed Hiroyuki Sanada as Kotsumoto\'s most loyal friend. He is the true picture as well for a warrior. <p> I have enjoyed Edward Zwick movies since I have begun watching them. Glory of course is the best. This movie may not quite live up to Glory but it is sure nice to see them making a film about a subject that I never thought we would see in film again. Although this movie never will live up to Shogun, it comes close thanks to the script by Logan, Zwick, and Herskovitz. They capture the very essence of a samurai in their screenplay. The set designs are beautiful, along with the costumes. Never have I seen a movie about Japan in the 1800\'s that looked so real. It gave you the feeling that you were there in Japan with them. The score by Hans Zimmer is equally impressive. Gone is the loud obnoxious music from MI:2 and other action score, and is a gorgeous sounding that never overpowers the movie but compliments it.<p> Despite the pro\'s we are given cons. One problem I had with the movie is the relationship between Algren and Taka (Koyuki) are never fully explored. I loved that story line. He kills her husband in battle and she is forced to help him heal. They grow closer and closer. I would have liked more. Also I had a problem with the ending. I understand why they did what they did, but I think it would have been a better ending with the final battle. But those were the only problems I could find with the movie.<p> So in the end, I recommend you seeing this movie. It brilliantly captures what life in Japan was at that time period. It showcases amazing performances by Watanabe, Cruise, and a great supporting cast. The cinematography is beautiful as is the set design. While the battles in this movie won\'t match up to a lot of others we see today it doesn\'t matter. This isn\'t a movie about battle but about living. Hence the quotes \"Tell me how he died.\" \"I will tell you how he lived.\" <p>8 out of 10'),(934,41,'B0001G6PZC','Dallas Buyers Club','Beautiful to Watch, But Stretches Reality...','\'The Last Samurai\' is yet another \'White Stranger in a Strange Land \' story.  The film has many similarities to Kevin Costner\'s \'Dances With Wolves\' (noted by other astute reviewers); the Civil War is major factor in both central character\'s state of mind.  Both men choose to side with the natives, rather than the exploitative European culture that spawned them.  Like \'Wolves\', this film is bloody and beautifully shot, with large battle sequences.<p>The supporting cast is excellent, with Ken Watanabe simply marvelous as the Samurai Leader, Katsumoto.  I found myself wondering just how this film would have played without the Tom Cruise character- I think just terrific, and would have been solely from the Japanese point of view.  I am dreaming here - Cruise shares producing credits, and the film probably would not have been made without his star power behind it.  Nevertheless, one does get tired of these movies with the \'Great White Hope\' leading the way for the natives.<p>The one area I have real doubts about is how quickly the Samurai were to accept a Westerner into their insular society in the film.  This really stretches the imagination - even today, Japan is not exactly eager to bring foreigners within it\'s inner circles.  Japan was a VERY closed society in 1876, yet we are to believe that the Cruise character literally becomes one of them in a matter of months!<p>The film is beautiful to watch, with spectacular action and realistic battle scenes.  In spite of the obvious plot flaws, the film takes the opportunity to teach the viewer about Japanese culture; one sees the impact on future events (WWII and the Bushido Code, for example).  The final battle is inspiring, with the Spartan stand at Thermopylae being used to rally the Samurai against a clearly superior enemy.<p>All in all, \'The Last Samurai\' was enjoyable in spite of it\'s Hollywood origins.  The whole idea of Tom Cruise as an adopted Japanese Samurai warrior really is farfetched, but somehow I left this film still impressed.  What it really comes down to is the supporting cast - they carried the film.  \'Samurai\' is really about Japan, and the Japanese actors did themselves and director Ed Zwick proud!'),(935,41,'B0001G6PZC','Dallas Buyers Club','Excellent Movie','Amazing story, great cinematography.

However, during the first losing battle, he was captured and held as a prisoner at the camp filled with trained samurais. Then he falls in love with a wife of the slained warrior he killed during the first war in Japan. While he is living in the village as a \"slave\"; he learns the culture of the samurai people. Then he learns how to fight like them as well. After he is released and returned back to the then modern day Tokyo, he isn\'t welcomed among friends because he wears the samurai clothes instead of civilian clothes of the 1860\'s. Then Samurai General is kidnapped and thrown in the dungeon. Tom rescues him from prison  and escapes back to the village. They prepares for the war the following week.

I\'m not always an avid fan of him and that has nothing to do with his Scientology views but this ranks as one of his best performances as a damaged Civil War vet who regains a sense of self when he encounters the Japanese culture--in particular, bushido.  Ken Watanabe is also excellent in his first starring English role and I think he was nominated for an Oscar if I\'m not mistaken.

All of these are valid points, but they lack support in light of the countless historical revisions filmed over the decades. One need only go back before the dawn of political correctness to see evidence of the contrary view of history; God-fearing white folk trying to scrape out a living on the frontier despite the devilish torment of the savage Injuns or white crusaders for Christ bringing salvation to the ignorant heathens beyond our shores. For the older among you who take exception to movies like The Last Samurai, Dances with Wolves, et al, I suggest you watch Birth of a Nation for some needed balance.<br />Furthermore, this movie never claims to be based on facts, so criticizing it for failing to represent history is the weak tool of conservatives too blinded by their own belief that America can do no wrong. These narrow-minded fools are no better than their self-righteous America-bashing adversaries. Somewhere in the middle lies reality.<br />The Last Samurai is an epic drama that focuses on the changes in a world, in a nation, and in a man. Troubled by his own violent past, Captain Algren (Tom Cruise in his limited, grinning, wide-eyed fashion) is the man who finds peace and forgiveness within himself through forced tenure among the Japanese in a Samurai village in 1876. The need for Cruise\'s character is debatable because the story of old ways coming to their end at the hands of dubious progress is worthy in and of itself, but this is a Hollywood movie and the movie never hides from its intended audience. The real treasure is in the sweeping scope of the cinematography, the insight to a way of life dramatically different from our own, powerful performances from the largely Japanese cast, an emotional score, and yes, the message, heavy-handed though it is.<br />Hollywood and history make for strange bedfellows, be it Jesus Christ or the Roman Empire, Jesse James or Wyatt Earp, Hollywood never takes on a historical character or movement it can\'t bring sympathy to using self-indulgent poetic license. Were it not morally reprehensible, they\'d probably manage to make a compassionate film about the Nazis....if they haven\'t already.<br />There aren\'t a lot of great epic movies made because the balance between grandeur and excess or drama and action is perilous to maintain. The Last Samurai is worth the lengthy investment of time for the stirring emotional outpouring it wrenches from those willing to excuse the flaws and occasional cloying misstep.'),(954,42,'B0001G6PZC','Dallas Buyers Club','BluRay The Last Samurai','Received shipment sooner than the anticipated timeline provided.

However, his performance is spot on in my opinion.  You can sense his seriousness and issues with the American army\'s and his own actions of the war.  You can sense his appreciation of Eastern culture and his experience as a Civil War veteran through his eyes, his body language, and the delivery of his lines.  While I thought seeing Cruise dressed as a samurai would be unbelievable, his performance transforms his character so well that by the end of the movie when he dons the samurai outfit, I was completely convinced.  Other performances are great as well, including Timothy Spall (the photographer) and especially Ken Watanabe.  The story is extremely well written and the action scenes are well done, with no extra choreography or special effects that make the action seem less authentic.  Finally, the score by Hans Zimmer.  It\'s easily my favorite thing about the film, and it\'s quite possibly the best soundtrack and score composed without being grandiose.  Zimmer uses many simplistic pieces that have two-note melodies but they\'re so poignant and fitting, that you can\'t not be moved by many scenes.  While some scenes are overly dramatic (like most of Edward Zwick\'s films), The Last Samurai is one of my all-time favorite films and deserves to be seen as equally as legendary and epic as similar films such as Braveheart and Gladiator.'),(957,42,'B0001G6PZC','Dallas Buyers Club','Good War Drama!','Tom Cruise and Ken Watanabe star in this 2003 war drama.<br />During the Civil War, A Captain meets a Samurai Leader<br />and learns from him.

A drunkard and actually a warrior seeking some means of relief from his tormenting dreams and conscience..Tom Cruise displayed that. The script was well written and the acting was well done. Warning that there are some gory scenes of death and decapitation. Therefore, it is a movie that is not for young children.'),(962,43,'B0001G6PZC','Dallas Buyers Club','Great Father\'s Day Gift!','One of Tom Cruise\'s best, I wish he made more films like this!

Thanks Amazon.'),(963,43,'B0001G6PZC','Dallas Buyers Club','Movie: 4 Stars; Extras 2 Stars','For a picture of life in Japan during the Meiji Era (1868-1912), this movie does an excellent job of showing the division between the two societies battling for supremecy: the traditional Samurai and the new Western-style rule.  Cruise\'s character allows the viewer to be introduced into this foreign society, as well as see how his disillusionment mirrors some of the frustration that Katsumoto and his follower feel about the Emporer\'s abandonment of the old ways.  Granted, this is a highly romanticized view of the time period, and the ending may strike viewers as overly sappy, but overall, this is a solid story of adversity, change, and adaption during a tumultuous time.<br /><br />The extras, however, fail the movie in several different ways.  The commentary by Zwick is ok, if not a little boring, but two features that fall short of comeptency are:<br /><br />The History Channel: History vs. Hollywood<br /> - This is a truncated episode (\"mini-doc\")that leaves a lot of detail out.  While the Cruise interview carries what there is, the doc hints at some analysis on why one person believes the movie\'s storyline is very Hollywood.<br /><br />Japan Premiers<br /> - Footage of the 2003 premiers at both Tokyo and Kyoto.  Features interviews primarily of the Japanese cast and crew.  However, all of the Japanese interviews are in Japanese and no translation is available.  Since this is one of the only places where the Japanese actors speak at any length about their roles and experiences, not having translation available cheapens the inclusion in this Blu-ray disc.<br /><br />Considering the above, get this for the movie and enjoy it.  Then, watch the documentaries, but lower your expectations.'),(988,43,'B0001G6PZC','Dallas Buyers Club','Great','This edition is very good. The movie is excellent and look authentic.

It\'s 1876, bare months after Custer\'s Last Stand, and Capt. Nathan Algren (Tom Cruise), a survivor of the Seventh Cavalry, is working as a huckster for the Winchester rifle company and doing his best to drown himself in drink.  Like Frank Hopkins of <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JMOW\">Hidalgo (Widescreen Edition)</a>, he\'s tormented by memories of an attack on a camp of peaceable Indians--and quite ready to kill the C.O. (Tony Goldwyn) who ordered it.  When his old sergeant, Zebulon Gant (Billy Connelly), finds him and suggests the existence of a job just suited to him, he\'s intrigued, but his old Colonel\'s presence on the team does nothing for his enthusiasm.  The money does: $500 a month to travel to Japan, where the young Emperor Meiji (Shichinosuke Nakamura) has embarked upon a program to unify his country and bring in Western technology, and there help train the Imperial Army to fight a rebellious Samurai lord named Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe).  The Army turns out to be a ragtag band of conscripts that breaks in terror when it first faces the rebels, leaving Algren and Gant virtually alone, and when Gant is killed Algren goes berserk.  Katsumoto is deeply impressed by his fighting, and when Algren collapses, wounded and exhausted, he refuses to permit the American to be slain; instead, he takes him along as a prisoner, hoping to \"understand our new enemy.\"  Slowly recovering his strength in the Samurai stronghold, Algren is at first little impressed by the Samurai ethos, but slowly he begins to realize the genuineness of their dedication and spirituality; always a quick study, he learns to speak Japanese and becomes so expert with the wooden practice swords that he fights Katsumoto\'s best warrior, Ujio (Jiroyuki Sanada), to a draw; and slowly he begins to understand that the Samurai, like the Indians, are fighting for their way of life.  A strange friendship grows up between him and Katsumoto, and Algren also finds himself attracted to his host\'s sister, whose husband he killed in the battle.  When the Emperor offers Katsumoto a safe-conduct to Tokyo, Algren goes there with him and is ready to leave the country, but on learning that the Samurai has been arrested and condemned to death, he engineers a daring plan to free him, and joins him in one last glorious but futile stand against the forces of modernity.<br /><br />Algren isn\'t always a likeable character, but he\'s very human and comprehensible, and Cruise portrays with sensitivity and believability his slow conversion to the Samuari cause.  (The film is based on fact: curious viewers might want to consult Wikipedia\'s article on the Meiji Restoration to see how it all began and what effects it had on later Japanese history, including the country\'s character today.)  Hans Zimmer\'s thunderous score <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000DZTIW\">The Last Samurai</a> and the excellently choreographed duel and battle scenes are pluses, and while the movie is rated R for violence, discreet and creative camerawork prevents any really shocking or disgusting sequences.

It was a little troubling to see Cruise\'s character completely master Katana technique and Iai waza in a single season, but I guess he had to to keep the plot moving.  Also, Cruise is a bit like Milton Berle - he has to be the last man off of every scene.  But Watanabe steals the movie and the supporting cast is terrific.  For once, Cruise doesn\'t seduce the woman who is forced to keep him in her house, and she complains that he smells bad. <p>In the end, the movie is a spectacular paen to Bushido culture. (I haven\'t yet asked an old friend of mine who survived Bataan what he thought of this movie).  The movie tackles a tricky and contradictory period of Japanese history, the great inner conflict between modernists (who won) and the feudalists, who probably were not all noble.  But heck, its the action scenes which are worth enduring Tom Cruise, and I sure liked watching him get pummeled by Watanabe\'s No. 2.  <p>If Japan rejected the West as the movie ultimately indicates, it sure didn\'t last long.

Here, Tom Cruise is the stranger in a strange land, and the Samurai of Japan are the warrior culture. <p>Being no stranger to Samurai films of Japanese history, I was pleased by all aspects of \"The Last Samurai.\"  Both the modernizing Meji government and the past-looking Samurai of the period are well represented, although the Samurai come out looking much better.  The warrior code of Bushido is not explained, and the lifestyle is completely romanticized, yet this is a movie and not a history text.  Emperor Meji is well-played, which surprised me.  He is neither hero nor villain.  And there are ninjas, which improves every film.<p>In the vein of the big Hollywood epics, \"The Last Samurai\" serves up healthy doses of sweeping score, beautiful vistas and Japan-landscape eye candy.  The country has rarely looked so beautiful, although I bet some technicians spent plenty of time computer-erasing the omni-present power lines.  The samurai armor,while not historically accurate, looks beautiful on film.  There are more than a few scenes that leap beautifully from a Kurosawa flick.

One of my friends who hates when Americans usurp a role that should have been played by a person indigenous to the country the movie was set in refused to see it.  However, Tom Cruise does not and cannot steal the spotlight in this movie.  The spotlight is aptly directed at the true last samurai and the actors that play them (and do so excellently).  The Japanese locales that the movie is shot in are absolutely breathtaking - they reminded me of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\'s snapshots of China.

The Last Samurai is. Historical? Hardly. Take a few grains: yes, Samurai existed in Japan as an ancient, militaristic culture, a law unto themselves, & Japan was opening itself up to the west at the time of the movie (1876). Aside from that... Cruise is an emotionally damaged hero of the civil & Indian wars. He is contracted to whip the Japanese army into a fighting force. Who is the enemy? The Samurai, who are much admired & feared through-out Japan. They refuse to surrender to modernity & give up their way of life. In battle he is captured by the Samurai. Their leader is played very well by Ken Watenabe. He is impressed by Cruise\'s fighting skills & spares him. Can you guess the rest? Of course. It\'s right out of Dances with Wolves but probably less accurate. While a prisoner he adopts the Samurai lifestyle.  Oh the pain, the inner conflict, the over-acting. I said it was a GOOD movie (C+). That\'s it. The Samurai are doomed, destroyed by time  more than anything else. Well done battle scenes. Lots of really good extras in this two disc set. Cruise is really charismatic & likeable in the extensive interviews he gave. He put a lot of time & effort into this movie. Lots of background & interviews with other principals. They even had The History Channel episode History or Hollywood? about the movie & the \"history\" behind it. In some ways the extras are better than the movie.'),(1023,47,'B0001G6PZC','Dallas Buyers Club','An enjoyable cinematic experience','The year is 1876, Captain Nathan Algren (Tom Cruise) has been hired by the Japanese in order to help the Imperial Japanese Army become more \'modern\' and less \'traditional\' and ultimately prepare them to fight the legendary Samurai. Events occur that cause Tom Cruise to be a captive of the deadly but extremely polite Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe) who is the leader of the Japanese Samurai. This is where the movie really starts to shine and and a beautiful forgotten world that we know little about comes alive thanks to the great director Edward Zwick and the ledgendary Hans Zimmer brings an unforgettable soundtrack.<br /><br />Tom Cruise has been in the movie industry for a long time and to date in my opinion this is by far his best performance. He discovered after his capture that the samurai are peaceful and as bad as they are made out to be, Cruise\'s character becomes emotionally bound to them and he integrates himself into their society after working hard to earn their trust. Another special part of the film is that a relationship develops between Algren and a quiet widow by the name of Taka, however this isn\'t a main part of the film it shows that the film isn\'t all about power and a disappearing nation but an emotional and beautiful aspect of the film.<br /><br />The Last Samurai is a deep emotional and violent film which has become a  triumphant in the movie industry.

I didn\'t see any of the reckless grinning that he known for, and he did a great portrayal of a disillusioned but fierce and loyal soldier. And this was exactly how many of the samurai felt in that era. This was a great fantasy film about a time of great change in Japan. You have to remember this is a fairy tale, but the Meiji Restoration was a turning point in Japan\'s history that I am happy that Americans can be better aquainted with. And the love scenes were well crafted, no obligatory sex scene (thats absolutely impossible for a gaijin and nihonjin in that time period!!!)

I was attracted to the idea of an American soldier, as played by Tom Cruise, and a group of samurai.  However, what I discovered was a carbon copy of other works by director Edward Zwick, plus a little \"Dances With Wolves\" on the side.<br /><br />Let\'s see: Tom Cruise plays an outcast soldier who finds himself looking for redemption in the company of some samurai, who kidnap him while training some Japanese soldiers to fight against those samurai.  This is like Matthew Broderick, who plays a soldier and finds redemption by training and commanding a group of African-Americans in \"Glory\" -Zwick\'s best movie.  Also, it\'s similar to \"Legends Of The Fall\", where Brad Pitt plays a desertor from the Army during WWI and finds redemption with a group of indians.  So, in those Edward Zwick movies, we find outcast soldiers in Broderick, Pitt, and Cruise.  Ah, and let\'s not forget Kevin Costner, who also plays an outcast soldier who finds comfort with the Sioux in \"Dances With Wolves\"; only Zwick didn\'t direct that movie, Costner did.<br /><br />However, not all in \"The Last Samurai\" is negative.  I have to admit that I fell in love with LOTR\'s Ngila Dickson\'s costumes; the cinematography by, I think, by Caleb Deschanel is truly enchanting; Ken Watanabe\'s outstanding performance as samurai leader Katsumoto is electrifying and charming at the same time; and, more importantly, Hans Zimmer\'s eclectic and marvelous music score, which I consider a great guilty pleasure of mine.<br /><br />In the end, I don\'t think \"The Last Samurai\" is a classic.  I just wished Edward Zwick had taken a different approach on a film that promised too much.'),(1178,48,'B0001G6PZC','Dallas Buyers Club','A film of texture and substance','When it first came out, i had no interest as i felt after learning of the story, that while tom cruise is a good action film actor, he didnt possess the depth of skill to pull off a film of this nature.<br /><br />After catching pieces of it on cable, i decided to make an effort and watch it from beginning to end, and did so a second time.  I then bought it and watched it  again.  I became immersed in it more deeply each time, realizing that there is a great deal of subtlety and depth not obtainable from an initial viewing.  From the strength of the superb supporting characters, to the gradual changing of cruise\'s character, and the details of the time re-created so credibly by the filmmakers, this was an excellent film of substance, not traditionally done by hollywood.<br /><br />While i have seen Dances with wolves, as others have complained about the lack of originality of the storyline, i feel that not to be completely accurate.  I also feel cruise\'s portrayal was more convincing than Costner\'s, and that this film is of equal power and effectiveness.  There are, like all films, weaknesses, such as the lack of exploration of the samurai\'s rejection of modernity, (a deleted scene on disc 2 touches upon this), and the dialogue can be a bit lacking, such as the exchange between katsumoto and the emperor as to how the situation should be handled, these are minor in the grand epic that is the last samurai.  Watch it with an open mind, and scrutinize the background/secondary characters, all of whom - especially ujio - were excellent.  And imho, it was a better picture than Return of the king, but than again, hollywood picked Titanic over LA Confidential for best picture, so who said hollywood is a place for the intelligent?'),(1179,48,'B0001G6PZC','Dallas Buyers Club','Awesome','What a great movie.

This movie is great all around, of course there are things that someone will complain about, but I am completely satisfied with this film. Every actor/actress (Cruise, Watanabe, etc.) pull off each roll so believably, that you tend to either want or plain out give all your attention to this path that the Samurai take. The fighting is great because it shows the actually processes that original Samurai used to both follow, show, and perform in their everyday lives. Some of the images are straight out of a dream or a book about the Samurai. The areas are just gorgeous. The foreign actors, also bring a whole new respect to all others through this film.

The way that he acted throughout the movie could give him the Oscar in the Best Supporting Actor Catagory. The entire movie could win many different awards, and I\'m glad that Tom Cruise was not nominated, because I have seen him in much better roles, like \"Minority Report,\" or \"Vanilla Sky.\" His great scene comes towards the end, where he gives emotion and power at once.<p>Cruise plays Captain Nathan Algren, a Civil War hero who loves to drink. He\'s recently come from battling American Indians in the west, and often had bad memories of what took place during those battles. But Algren gets a job when Japanese businessman Omura wants him to train the new army, with somebody that he knows Bagley. Bagley wants Algren because of the way that he battled the Indians. Algren agrees when he is able to bring his fellow Army fighter Sergeant Zebulon Gant. When they make it to Japan, they are met by the translator Simon Graham, and they begin to train the troops for battle. But Omura wants them to fight the samurai and their leader Katsumoto right away, and overrules Algren causing him to take his inexperienced troops to battle the Katsumoto. Algren is almost killed during the battle, but taken back to Katsumoto\'s village, which is ruled by his son. Algren is trapped, and there is no way for him to be able to return back to Japan. While with Katsumoto, he learns all about the way of the samurai and he finds out that there is nothing wrong with the people that Omura wants to kill.

The good news: this is a big, beautiful movie relating an unusual story. In 1876 California an ex-Union officer Captain Nathan Algren (Tom Cruise), who has battle scars both physical and psychic, is hired by Japanese diplomats to train an American-style army for the Emperor, conscripted against a renegade samurai Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe). Katsumoto hates the Western ways increasingly threatening Japan. (Katsumoto\'s tragic story is not really that distant: it was only three decades ago that Yukio Mishima, frustrated in his attempt to protect Japan from the sterile corruption of Westernization, committed seppuku.) Algren\'s campaign to train the Emperor\'s forces is not too successful (when he orders them to hold fire, they don\'t), and his first encounter with the rebel forces finds him a wounded prisoner. Algren is taken to Katsumoto\'s mountain outpost and kept alive so that \"we may learn our enemy\". One aspect of Japanese culture Algren is immediately obssessed with is sake; but as his stay lengthens he becomes more attentive, learning the language, mastering kendo, and enjoying a Kyogen performance. In return, he attempts to teach baseball to the village boys; but they seem to miss the concept, trying to catch the base runner instead of the ball. (They\'ve come a long way.) Cruise is an attractive actor, and this may be his best performance to date. Algren is introduced as a bitter, indeed a broken man; but as his outlook becomes more philosophical there is a sincere depiction of a character desiring to understand the strange world around him. Cruise\'s scenes with Watanabe, another charismatic actor, are the film\'s most defining. Eventually, Algren takes sides with the samurai rebel, and when their Japanese forces face the Emperor\'s Japanese forces on the battlefield, it must seem like d&eacute;j&agrave; vu to the Civil War veteran, but this point is not belabored. The climatic battle is strikingly photographed by John Toll, as is the whole production. The world of mid-19th Century Japan is richly reproduced, and there\'s even a fascinating glimpse of 1876 San Francisco. The bad news: there is a major problem with \"The Last Samurai\" and it\'s the ending. Why in the name of Chikamatsu did Zwick and his co-scenarists Marshall Herskovitz and John Logan, after creating such a sensitive and arresting story, mar it with such a weak conclusion? All we need is a Henry Mancini coda. But, the ending notwithstanding, \"The Last Samurai\", spectacular and intelligent, was one of the best movies of 2003.'),(1188,49,'B0001G6PZC','Dallas Buyers Club','What a great movie!','What a rush!

Samurai','The Last Samurai is a Romantic film starring Tom Cruise as Captain Nathan Algren, a leader in the US army whose experiences in driving out Indian tribes such as the Cheyenne have not left him. Algren is a compulsive drinker, his drinking helps him to forget the Indian massacres of which he took part in, yet he cannot stop his nightmares. When asked to accept a job training the modern Japanese army far across the Pacific, he accepts the offer for money. He accepts, and the poorly trained army is attempted to be taught by the US generals ready to impress the modernity craving japanese emperor, and thus there is a push to attack the rebellious \"Samurai\" culture - those who are standing up for that which is not modern, retaining their old values and traditions and insisting on using classical weapons and not gaudy rifles. Tom Cruise does not believe that the poorly trained modern Japanese militia group can yet tackle the Samurai, and he has not yet learned enough of them. When the fight occurs, most of the modern army is killed or runs away. Algren is left to fight \"flag\" to sword combat with 5 efficiently trained Samurai warriors, who he presently manages to fight off as the flag he holds of a white tiger symbolizes this new white man with a robust vigor and bravery in such a subject. When he collapses, he still manages to kill one more Samurai who was about to end Algren\'s own life. Right before the other four Samurai exact their revenge, the rebellious leader, Katsumoto, stops them and takes him back to the Samurai village. There he is taken care of, yet throughout this time the story beings to wither. Sentimental and exciting yes, but the culture issue clearly posted a problem which the writers efficiently yet hastily attempted to cover up. During this period of recovery, there is much conversation between Algren and Katsumoto, the only other English speaker. There is much shared between the two cultures, and Algren learns to adapt to the Samurai way of life. Yet this has its weak points; such a brave Samurai reactionary community who stuck to their ideas would not have been so open to Algren; later on in the movie Algren even kisses the wife of the samurai he kills earlier. Of course it is a short kiss, and it takes an interminable amount of time for it to happen, but its sentiment was its only purpose for existing; it was not a realistic idea no matter how paternalistic or subservient women in the culture were. Complements of course to the directors and the writers for the usage of symbolism. For example, Algren stays with the Samurai for almost a year, honing up on his skills and learning Japanese. When he is returned with safe conduct back to the modern area, he is received among a flurry of rapid and liberal changes. The army has uniforms, is extremely well-trained, and in addition has access to Howitzer cannons and 200 round per minute machine guns. Algren realizes what has happened, and stops his drinking, symbolic of finally confronting his problems. After learning that Katsumoto will be killed for such an idea, he rescues him and joins with the Samurai. THe rescue of course is slightly unrealistic. One of the Samurai virtues is shame in losing, causing them to commit suicide as part of their culture. Katsumoto must do so or be killed by the modern Japanese, as they leave him in a room with a knife. When Algren shows up with a witty Bond line, there is little intercourse before the conservative leader willingly gives up his tradition and agrees to escape. Again, good movie, good entertainment, but also great clashing in cultural tradition. There is a nice allusion to Thermopylae later on, as the 500 Samurai prepare to fight the now several thousand modern Japanese troops when safely back in the Samurai village. When they are back, Katsumoto mentions to Algren about a specific blossoming tree while in an orchard with many such trees and many such blossoms. Katsumoto notes that just like the blossoms, the people would slowly die out. As they prepare for the modern Japanese attack, the relationship is furthered between Algren and Taka, the woman whose husband he killed. She allows him to wear her husband\'s Samurai armor, and they kiss. THAT is an error, a bad direction which should not have been ventured in. From here, the movie becomes interminable as the climax music is played and calmed and replayed, the apparent final battle stretching into more than one; the apparent final scene still an hour from the end. The fighting scenes are numerous, and though they entertain the eyes they bore the mind. One asks, which battle will end the fighting? Finally, there are but less than a score of Samurai calvalry left alive, and the modern Japanese general commands the army to mow them down using the perhaps 5 or 6 new machine guns. THough Algren and Katsumoto heroically ride in front and are shot by the guns last, this scene is EXCELLENTLY done as the director dims all sound during hte firing of the guns and accentuates the ease of cranking the new machines, a slow crank to pump 200 rounds per minute. Of course these 1877 war machines were most likely loud and imperfect, but the director portrays the focus of the ease of turning the cranking and mowing down some of the final cultural remains of Japan to symbolize the ease of supporting modernity and the ease of ignoring the previous culture, the ease in going with the flow. Of course, as soon as Katsumoto goes down, even in disregard to the general, the whole modern Japanese army take off their hats and bow to the dead leader, who decided now it IS okay for him to commit suicide, changing back to his tradition. It is Algren\'s fate to survive every battle he is in, thus he is the \"last samurai,\" the only man left, and there is a clear disappointment when the army bows down instead of allowing his torture to continue. Yet the movie is not over... Algren must talk to the emperor (and this is where it gets really cheesy) and walk in right before the US treaty is signed and give him insight into the Samurai way of life, causing him to reject the treaty and explain that his country could not ignore their heritage. The end of the story is narrated by a Historian of whom i failed to mention earlier, one who is from England and supports the modern side but helps Algren and other Samurai to get Katsumoto to escape. His role is portrayed as unbiased, and he is given Algren\'s diary and explanations to write a book. Clearly a Romantic movie about non-conformity and fighting for the conservative and traditional values of an antique heritage, the narrator describes how the \"American Captain\'s\" history after that was a legend, listing some beliefs. The end of the movie portrays Algren walking back to the Samurai town, where on the way (another excellent job) one of the blossoming trees which Katsumoto points out earlier can be seen in the background - not with a multitude of flowers but rather very few; a dying but surviving culture. As he enters the town, Taka sees him and smiles. So for all intensive purposes, this movie would get a B. It is entertaining, there is a hint of suspense, and there is an excellent use of symbols. Yet, the movie tends to make several errors (such as tense scenes where the reactinary Samurai tradition is forfeited easily for a liberal idea, or when there are unbiased intercultural relations) and it tends to go on far too long. I would reccomend paying 9 dollars to see this movie, especially if you don\'t analyze everything like I do. The movie makes sense, the plot makes sense, but an intellectual may find him or herself occupied in simply enjoying bloody intense fighting as a sacrifice in place of any thought process whatsoever.'),(1191,50,'B0001G6PZC','Dallas Buyers Club','Lord of the Rings meets Braveheart but not only..','Being that this film is based on actual historical occurences it could\'ve been the typical Hollywood silliness extraordinaire complete with massive innacuracies, tons of cheese and syrup, and a dishwashed script.<p>  Incredibly, most of the above was avoided with the exception maybe of the historical innacuracies but even those coul\'ve been severe and they weren\'t.<p>  As the plot has been detailed by other reviewers I\'ll stick to the impression this film leaves you with. The \"Last Samurai\" is actually a pretty cool flick. The theme (encountered in other older films as well) of the westerner who goes over to Asia with the mindset of a clueless brute only to be engulfed by the age-old philosophy he comes in contact with there is well in effect here and it works like a dandy.<p>  Cruise gives his usual very good performance but the show is actually stolen by the Japanese cast headed by the \"Katsumoto\" character (the Samurai leader) who\'s simply a treat to watch.<p>  There is loads of battling in vast open fields and a lot of gore that accompanies it, and these escenes are absolutely great. The martian arts choreography is excellent and the filming is impeccable as well.<p>  But what makes the film really tick are the sequences where after Cruise has been captured by the Samurai he has long and intriguing conversations with Katsumoto while at the same time he\'s trying to come to grips with a culture he not only doesnt understand but which charms him to death. These sequences are the top stuff this film has to offer and it does so with style.<p>  While the Last Samurai does remind of the Lord of the Rings when it comes to the spectacular battle scene and it equally reminds of Braveheart with the super-underdogs taking on bravely the hordes of mechanised soldiers sent by the emperor to crush their rebellion it still maintains a life and heart of its own and keeps you hooked till the end which is (sadly)predictable, conventional and somewhat corny.<p>  That, along with the fact that it is probably 20 minutes too long are the only minuses i could attribute to it. Sure, this is Hollywood spreading cliches again, as the Samurai werent as noble as they are usually portrayed since they mindlessly accepted any order coming from the emperor and that included massacring \"opponents\" at his order regardless of guilt or innocence. But this type of cliche was to be expected.<p>  Overall though, this is a probably unexpectedly cool film. Definately recommended, allthough if you see it on a small screen you\'ll be inevitably missing out on the great photography and camera work, but most importnatly the stunning combat scenes, many of which are shot aereally.'),(1192,50,'B0001G6PZC','Dallas Buyers Club','Samurai deserves to be \"Last\"','Recipe for instant Tom Cruise samurai flick: Take your basic samurai period drama, insert Tom Cruise, and water down liberally. Stir in cliches and do not season at all. The result? \"The Last Samurai,\" a very dull, colorless action flick set in Japan. It\'s not a good sign when the New Zealand scenery is the most striking thing about the whole thing.<br /><br />It\'s the mid-1800s and times are a-changin\' in Japan -- the modernization of the west (meaning the USA) is sweeping away the old ways. The Emperor gets an American veteran named Nathan Algren to help train his troops. Algren is an alcoholic, filled with angst because he killed American Indians, and he hates his new job.<br /><br />Suddenly he\'s captured during an attack by samurai Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe) and dragged back to his village. After going cold turkey, he begins to appreciate the old samurai code and ways, and begins to fall in love with a beautiful widow. Taking the side of his new allies, he sets out on a seemingly doomed attack, against the very people he was sent to help... and his own troops.<br /><br />Even taken out of the historical context, \"Last Samurai\" is a deeply annoying film. It\'s laced with heavy-handed political correctness, complete with pointless insertions about American Indians and Custer. It\'s also  saddled with a surreally optimistic ending. Everying about it -- from Cruise\'s love interest to his change of heart -- is predictable, cliched and very corny.<br /><br />While the film is SET in Japan, the actual shooting took place in New Zealand, giving it a lush, almost fantastical backdrop for all the action. Certainly it makes director Edward Zwick\'s job a bit easier, even if the film is saddled with some very stilted dialogue. (\"And though it may forever be obscure to me, I cannot but be aware of its power.\") And enough with the \"Bob\" comments.<br /><br />Tom Cruise shows little emotion, and his character\'s alcoholic angst is almost laughably contrived. In fact, you may cheer when he gets beaten up. Ken Watanabe is what makes the film -- he has the presence of a future screen legend, and he plays Katsumoto with vulnerabilities and real feelings. This guy deserves to be the lead of such a film. Koyuki also shows incredible expressiveness as the widow Taka.<br /><br />For a well-acted, well-directed film that happens to be set in Japan, check out the immortal samurai films by Kurosawa.

As anyone who\'s studied Japanese history can tell you, the conflict herein was almost perfectly portrayed on all levels; within the government, within the characters, and within the nation (Japan) as a whole.<br /><br />Set in the 1890\'s when Japan\'s emperor Meiji was trying desperately to \"modernize\" (read \"westernize\") Japan, we get to see an American\'s perspective on the wars that are ravaging the old nation of Japan.  While many Japanese people were trying so hard to be fashionable and up to date, there were a great many who felt that the country was being robbed of it\'s heritage and the ideals that were so strongly ingrained in the people as a whole were being tossed to the side all in the name of \"catching up with the rest of the world.\"  It\'s tragic to watch as the young emperor is manipulated by his advisors into betraying the one man whom he should have listened to all along; his former teacher and mentor Katsumoto.<br /><br />During all of this, however, Tom Cruise is thrown into the mix as Nathan Algren, a retired Civil War hero who won acclaim for himself for massacreing the plains indians in the Nazi-esque style of the time (\"I was just following orders at the time, sir\").  Upon his arrival in Japan, his desperation for the sweet abyss of death is just out of reach time and again, but it is his capture by the \"enemy\" where he finds his redemption. <p>Some people who have reviewed this film refuse to see the Samurai as anything but bloodthirsty and savage (much like too many people saw the Native Americans), which couldn\'t be farther from the truth.  A peaceful people by nature, but stoic and steadfast in their beliefs of honor and discipline (two words that are unfortunately lost on most Americans these days), the Samurai sought only to keep their country pure from foreign influence (a noble cause, if a bit misplaced and/or closed-minded) out of fear that their own way of life would go the way of the Indian (which it did anyway), and herein lies the true power of this film.<br /><br />From the beginning of the film, anyone with any knowledge of Japanese history (or even of modern Japan) knows that the Samurai are ultimately doomed to die.  I knew this going in, but found that this movie kindled a hope in me that they could ultimately win and save their country from itself as the samurai way saved Algren (Tom Cruise) from himself.  While Algren succeeds, he and his cause ultimately fail and the emperor realizes this only too late as too much has already been set in motion due to the machinations of his scheming advisors who are only in it to line their own pockets (which is totally historically accurate; the merchant class saw in \"westernization\" a way to finally grow in social stature and the Samurai were standing in their way, so they used their newfound wealth and influence to eradicate the Samurai).<br /><br />Doomed from the beginning, this film is more about one man\'s triumph over his own demons than it is about a country falling apart.  Set against the backdrop of the Meiji \"restoration\"-era civil wars, there\'s no way this film doesn\'t succeed (except, perhaps, for the romantic interest which was unecessary but not to the point that it detracted anything from the film).  We root for the hero to overcome his own personal obstacles while watching him fight a losing battle against a place and time that ultimately implodes upon itself.  And while he comes out on top, and stronger for it, he is now  alone in his new world because those who got him to it have been slaughtered around him.<br /><br />All in all, the movie is tragic yet uplifting at the same time.  It IS historically accurate (no matter what anybody tells you, take it from someone who used to live in Japan and has studied Japanese history for 13 years), it is worth watching, and it was far more oscar-worthy than that abortion of a film about Japan \"Lost in Translation.\"'),(1208,46,'B0001G6PZC','Dallas Buyers Club','Another distorted Hollywood Blockbuster.','I just recently saw this movie for the first time.  When it first heard about it, I was somewhat sceptical about the movie, thinking that it would simply be another distorted Hollywoodization of an historical event or historical period.  I subsequently read reviews that claimed that it was in fact a great movie, a cut above as it were, and that the movie was sensitive towards Japanese culture etc.  In particular what I found most interesting was the claim that the movie was not the typical Western film where Western values are proven superior--that the reverse is in fact the case here.  But still, I was sceptical, and did not concern myself with the movie until just a few days ago.  All things considered, I think I was justified in my scepticism; while there were aspects that I found to be good and commendable (the majestic landscape, quite stunning combat sequences), for the most part I just did not find it to be a good film.  It is essentially a Hollywoodization, regardless of the unique twist to the story.'),(1209,46,'B0001G6PZC','Dallas Buyers Club','Great movie....let down by a cheesy Hollywood ending !!!','There is little to criticize about the vast majority of this extravaganza: the acting and direction are excellent, the cinematography is superb, the battle scenes are spectacular, all production values are first rate....BUT I was a bit disappointed by two factors.<br /><br />First, it is very difficult for me to believe that the Japanese widow would fall in love with the coarse, smelly, and (worst of all) foreign soldier who had killed her husband. Why love?? Could she not simply have respected him for his steadfast efforts toward reconciliation and his willingness to turn against his own countrymen on her (and her people\'s) behalf? When otherwise credible story lines start creating unlikely plot twists, especially near the conclusion of the movie, it is time to prepare for that most dreaded of all literary constructions: the \"Hollywood ending\".<br /><br />Which brings up my second point: I felt that the obviously \"tacked on\" (but predictable...see point one) \"happy ending\" was an insult to all events which preceded it. Out of the ENTIRE Samurai army, guess the identity of the single survivor of the this epic and heroic \"battle to the death\". Tell me this doesn\'t strain credibility beyond the breaking point. That the (heretofore gutless) Japanese emperor suddenly develops a spine and does the \"right thing\" when confronted by this (unnamed) survivor only further accentuates the absurdity of it all. It is a slap in the face.<br /><br />The ending was a cop out, and the movie would have been infinitely better if it had ended about 15 minutes sooner, on the battlefield and in a much more final and plausible way. I guess the title would have to be altered, but this might not be a bad thing due to the ambiguity about to whom it refers.<br /><br />I still recommend this movie for all of the substantial and compelling positive reasons cited above, but see if you don\'t share, or at least acknowledge, the basis for my criticism after you have watched it.'),(1210,46,'B0001G6PZC','Dallas Buyers Club','A Grand, But Formulaic Epic.','This epic film demonstrates that the technical competency of modern American filmmakers is complete.  But we already knew that, didn\'t we.<br /><br />However, in addition to technical virtuosity, there is undeniably artistic merit here.  In my mind the most artistic and therefore most interesting scene in the film is when Algren (Cruise) disembarks at Yokohama.  The lavish and loving care that obviously went into the creation of this time-piece set is impressive.  One could watch this scene over and over again, seeking new details each time, and enjoy the pastime.<br /><br />Further artistic inspiration comes from the natural settings provided by New Zealand, and in particular the composite cone of volcano Taranaki, standing in admirably for Fujiyama.  The geology of New Zealand is similar enough to Japan that this setting comes off very well in the story telling.  Also, kudos to the carpenters and design team who created the structures; this is really good stuff.<br /><br />Also in the positive column is the costumery, especially the Samurai armor.  All visual aspects of this film are superb.<br /><br />And so is the story line; there is much here to engage the imagination.<br /><br />This is withal a very good film, but with such elements described above going for it, it could have been a timeless classic of the filmmaker\'s art.  I acknowledge I may be far off the mark, but it seems to me these modern American filmmakers miss the mark time and again when it comes to where they ought to concentrate their efforts and imaginations, hence my accusation of this being a \"formulaic\" epic.<br /><br />These days a grandiose and expensively produced climactic battle is de rigueur, but why is this so?  Who decided this?  If you stop to think about it, is such extravagance necessary to tell this story?  In my opinion: no.  Is it necessary to make this film a financial success?  Again, in my opinion: no.  The short list of films I\'ve seen that have ripped my guts out with the intensity of their message have included not a single violent act, which is not to say some violence is never useful in telling a story, but it can almost  always be suggested, instead of graphically portrayed.  For me, these battle scenes are boring.  I submit the correct formula for great story telling is to make such scenes brief interludes, then get back to the human drama, which hopefully will include some inspiring dialogue.<br /><br />At one point Algren muses: \"I am beset by the ironies of my life.\"  Now here could be the beginning of something interesting, but this thought is not developed, and this nicely structured phrase is allowed to just drop.<br /><br />The heart of this story is the historical nexus of a medieval society attempting to catch up with the recently industrialized West, the dubious wisdom of doing so, and what might be left behind in so doing.  The human drama inherent in such events is truly the stuff of epic tales.  So why are these human dramas developed only briefly, and so much time and effort invested in fights and battles?  Clearly the producers think this is necessary for financial success.  It is not clear they are right about this.<br /><br />Other formulaic elements seem intended to add depth to the story, but accomplish the reverse.  We have the frontier cavalry as depraved and bad, and American Indians as noble and good.  We have the hatred of the heroically defiant and rebellious member of the frontier cavalry (whom we are prompted to love because he is so wise to be so rebellious; an island of wisdom in a sea of decadence) for his supposedly archetypal superior, with a result that will come as a complete surprise to all viewers who were born, so to speak, yesterday.<br /><br />I admit I\'m nitpicking here, but Taka, played by Koyuki, looks like the modern model she is.  She is as lovely as can be, but an actress of her physical stature must surely have been selected to cater to modern tastes (as decided by casting); a more typically diminutive Japanese actress would have been more convincing.<br /><br />So, my recommendation is to watch this movie because it has very considerable merit, but my question is: who decided modern American moviegoers are primarily induced to pay money to see gory battle scenes and care little about complex human interaction?  I think they got it backwards, and don\'t seem about to budge.'),(1211,46,'B0001G6PZC','Dallas Buyers Club','Epic movie in the traditions of \"Braveheart\"','Wow, what a movie!

As a man of minority I was not all that excited about seeing another movie that promotes \"whiteman\'s burden\". Why does Hollywood not trust  people with color with our own stories? The true story without the fictional character that Tom Cruise plays was just as intriguing.<br /><br />I must admit this was a good movie. It was cinematically lush and rich. The views, scenes, and camera shots were amazing and captures a spirit of Japan that is rarely seen. Hans Zimmer makes a emotionally captivating soundtrack. The costumes were well crafted period pieces. The actors gave commendable performances. I was most captivated by Ken Watanabe\'s performance. His character was a beautiful balance of opposites. He was powerful yet serene, and a leader yet a servant, a rebel yet was dedicated to the emperor. This was a tumultuous time in Japan\'s history in which tradition clashed with modernization. The tragic story would have been just as amazing without the fictional character that Cruise plays.  I found it hard to believe that a soldier caught and held prisoner for one winter would be able to master swordsmanship to the point that he could stalemate a samurai who has been studying for all his life. Details like that disappoint me. Even in a story as epic as Last Samurai, there had to be a Caucasian meddling in the middle of it all. Loosely based on the life of Siago Takamori, the movie is overall a good film. My criticism is that the movie suggests that Cruise\'s character is the Last Samurai. In a final scene the whole regiment of Japanese imperial soldiers bow down to a fallen Kastumoto. Algren holds the samurai, yet it appears that the whole of the troops are bowing to Algren!

Great camera work, nice action scenes, and alot of drama. I think many people would benefit from watching the old 70\'s movie Shogun.<br /><br />I think Cruise did a fine job. Was he \"striving for an Oscar\"? Don\'t know. Don\'t care. Why not let the movie and actors stand for themselves? Does he have the same personality in all his movies? Well, yah, sorta. But I\'m sorry so do most actors that people think are great. I love Anthony Hopkins myself, but he always seems the same. The only actor (another that I love) I can think of off the top of my head that is actually different in some of his movies is Gary Oldman and that\'s stretching it a bit.<br /><br />I liked the relationship between Cruise and the people of the village. He saw them as savages, and they saw him the same way. The \"relationship\" with his hostess didn\'t seem strained to me. She hated him because he was an unwashed savage that killed her husband, but as time progressed, no one could deny his trying not only to fit in but to not back down (which is something they would appreciate). And, he got on well with her kids. Call me chauvanistic here, but any man that is good with a woman\'s kids will hit a soft spot. And, there was no \"Take me, Cruise!!!\" scene at all in the movie. I don\'t see the problem. Also, he never was samurai. He appreciated their culture but admittedly didn\'t understand alot of it which is... understandable.<br /><br />As to the final part of the movie being overly done hollywood... I think SOMEONE had to survive. Someone had to bring this to the emperor\'s face and show it in a personal way. When you think about it, Algren was the only option for this. Was it cliche\'? Sure. But, had it just ended with them all dying, there would have been no resolution. Perhaps had the emperor been there to see it... then I would say you could just leave it at all the men dying and the emperor being moved by it, but he wasn\'t. So, someone had to bring this to him. It couldn\'t be Katsumoto, because he (and his sword) was the message itself. It couldn\'t have been the other samurai, because to do such a thing would have been not their place and disrespectful (culture gaps here). The only person who could to this, and get away with it, was Algren. He was NOT a samurai (and don\'t be confused into thinking  The Last Samurai\" referred to him, because it didn\'t. It referred to Katsumoto.), AND he represented a third party perspective. That was the clincher. The act moved an \"honorless white man\" (culture gap again) to come before the emperor and even offer to end his life in some accordance to the Bushido code. It WAS moving.<br /><br />And it wasn\'t saying that by becoming \"modernized\" the Japanese were doing wrong (as a reviewer put it). It was attempting to demonstrate and correct the attitude: the Western culture is better than ours and we must imitate them like a boy imitates his father. THAT\'S what Katsumoto was fighting against. You don\'t have to sterilize your current culture to move forward. Recognize what you have and are and move forward with pride in those things. Don\'t become a lapdog to cultures who see you as an oddity of backwards savages.

He\'s rescued by his old commanding officer, Col. Benjamin Bagley (Tony Goldwyn), who arranges for Algren to help train the Japanese Imperial Army in modern warfare techniques. The pay is $500 per month. Because of an incident in the campaign against the Indians that still causes Algren nightmares, cost him his self-perceived honor, and drove him to drink, Nathan tells his ex-CO that he\'ll kill anyone in Japan for $500 a month, but would gladly kill Bagley for free. Army camaraderie is not all it\'s cracked up to be. In any case, off both sail to Japan.<p>The Imperial government is bedeviled by rebel samurai warriors cranky about the increasing Westernization of society.

The character development is a bit loose and had somewhat of a rushed feeling. The story sometimes came off as unbelievable or inconsistent, for instance the first battle where Tom Cruise is captured really does not connect to the other part of the story. Tom being wounded defeats several samurai warriors, later his fighting skills were shown to be much more inept compared to the samurai. This did not seem consistent to me. The Japanese Emperor not knowing what to do and playing both sides of the fence seemed a bit unbelievable.<br /><br />You get the feeling that the reason why Ken Wantanabe\'s character respects Tom Cruise so much, is because that they both were tortured battle tired warriors. Overall, I did enjoy this film. It does have some beautiful cinematography. Nevertheless, the violence is extremely graphic and there are some scenes where Tom Cruise is drying out from alcoholism.'),(1226,48,'B0001G6PZC','Dallas Buyers Club','Thoroughly Entertaining','This movie held my attention all the way through.

I found the movie generally interesting and entertaining as a movie. However, as an historical epic it is quite lacking. The plot in the movie and especially the character played by Tom Cruise often reminded me of the \"Shogun\" television mini-series and the film \"Dances with Wolves.\" The ending also reminded me of \"The Charge of the Light Brigade,\" starring Errol Flynn. I also think \"The Last Samurai\" tends to somewhat overly romanticize the samurai in Japan of the 1860\'s.<br /><br />  People can honestly debate whether a film\'s significant historical inaccuracies justly merit criticism and/or an overall less favorable review. As an action movie i would rate \"The Last Samurai\" four stars. However, for many of the same reasons why I have considerable reservations about the very unrealistic character played by Kevin Costner in \"Dances with Wolves,\" I will give \"The Last Samurai\" only three stars.<br /><br />  \"The Last Samurai is certainly worth watching. However, the  army officer played by Tom Cruise detracts from the historical validity in the film of the negative reaction by many of the samurai to modernization efforts in Japan during the late 1860\'s. The movie would have been potentially better, in my opinion, if the samurai story had been told entirely from a Japanese point of view.'),(1228,48,'B0001G6PZC','Dallas Buyers Club','Finding spirit','I was captured by the strong similarities between Samuari culture and Native Americans back in the day.

Perhaps there were historical inaccuracies.....but its message was clear: One must not forget who they are, or where they come from.<br /><br />Highlight was Lord Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe), a samurai who envisioned a powerful animal while meditating.  His vision soon materializes following an encounter with Nathan Algren (Tom Cruise) in battle.  Similarly, with Native tribes of the Americas, dreams or visions were also very powerful.  As their encounter develops into respect,  Algren becomes a student of Katsumoto\'s people with curious intrigue, he learns their philosophy, their way of life and a peacefulness that he referred to as a \"deep reservoir of spirit\".<br /><br />Algren\'s flashbacks to his battle fought with Custer lends historical accuracy to an important part of U.S. history and occurs throughout the movie until his friendship with Katsumoto reaches a level of trust, respect, and compassion.  Samurai ALSO had to defend their way of life before total encroachment and defeat by Japan\'s imperial army, as portrayed. Enjoyable movie, wonderful Japanese cast: kudos to a fine actor, Ken Watanabe for putting self into his character that made me believe in Katsumoto, a man of integrity and honor.<br /><br />Musical score was absolutely beautiful!

I felt it should have deserved more credit for what it received. One of Tom Cruise\'s best performances of all-time. A GREAT story that was well told of a long forgotten group of warriors in Japan who fought and served with honor, excellence, and discipline with a purpose. Their duty lies in their name - Samurai=to serve. The most sophisticated warrior of its time. The scenes shot in the movie were picture perfect and awe-inspiring for admirers of Japanese culture and Japanese history. A story of West meets (Far)East. Tom Cruise\'s ignorant, cocky, character from the West leads to a humbling experience when he learns to live with the Samurai and understand their way of life. He reveals that they were not a barbaric people but instead a sophisticated society that lived in discipline. Opposite of what the West had perceived of the Samurai image. I recommend anyone to this movie and if you didnt know it will open up a new perception of a people who lived long ago.'),(1258,48,'B0001G6PZC','Dallas Buyers Club','Better Than Expected','Started out kinda shaky...Honestly almost turned it off but Cruise\'s performance held my interest so I kept watching.  Thank God I did because it really is a good film.  Sure there are a lot of bad things some people could say about it just to be mean - I hated a lot of the editing in the beginning and that goofy fat guy from Harry Potter Prisoner From Azkaban is terrible in it (most people I know just can\'t stand Tom Cruise - which is unfortunate because he is  a MUCH better actor than most people give him credit for).  The whole movie is carefully balanced by tremendous action sequences in the middle and final section of the film and the sympathetic Japanese characters (Watanabe, the love interest, the kids etc...). They are all so believable and easy to connect to.  Some of the negative reviews on here (Amazon) are criticizing Cruise\'s performance harshly and the role his character plays in influencing the samurai/japanese people etc...Really it is Cruise\'s character though who learns in this movie and not the other way around which the trailer for this film so mistakenly conveyed...And unfortunately prevented me from seeing it in the theater.  And believe me when I say that I am the LAST person to want to see some movie about a \"white man\" (let alone one of the biggest american movie stars in the world) showing some bada#$ \"samurai\" how its done in the skills of fighting...But the film works people.  It isn\'t Gladiator or Braveheart but the characters are interesting and compelling, and many of the action sequences are truly suspenseful and entertaining...Even rousing at times.  The biggest problem I had with it was the opening (for awhile it was beginning to feel like a poor man\'s version of \"Glory\" - a perfect film in my mind which Edward Zwick also directed).  This isn\'t \"Glory\" but it isn\'t bad either.  Cruise is one of the best actors out there I\'ve decided after watching this film.  People like calling him a \"vanity\" actor because he\'s such a major star and that he does roles that are in most cases larger than life...But what actor out there can honestly say they don\'t want that?  And besides he has done a wide array of roles and is surprisingly transformational...I say \"surprisingly\" simply because more people don\'t want to admit or recognize it...Think about how different he is in this from Born On The Fourth Of July or Collateral or Eyes Wide Shut or Color Of Money or Magnolia or Minority Report...The guy has some serious range people.  Don\'t be jealous \'cuz he\'s rich and good looking and has worked with some of the best directors ever (i.e. Oliver Stone, Kubrick, Spielberg, Scorsese, Brian De Palma, Tony Scott, Michael Mann).  Life\'s too short for that kinda talk people.

And most of the other epics have been staisfying as well, with \"Gladiator\" being but one standout.  But the Tom Cruise vehicle \"The Last Samurai\" it not one of the them.  Problems here start with the films bankable star.  The role of Nathan Algren is a challenging one, with emotional torture brewing behind his eyes and a sullen demanor in his walk.  But moments where Cruise hits these needed traits are few and far between.  Cruise plays Algren as a statue who poses as a heroic monolith for the camera, in other words Algren comes off as other characters Cruise has played in the past.  The only actor who stands out is Ken Watanabe, a Japanese actor who makes his english languange debut.  He brings a sense of dignity and intensity to the character of Katsumoto, a Samurai leader who is the last of a dying breed and a dying code<br /><br />Perhaps you can blame the films\' director, Edward Zwick (Legends of the Fall, The Siege).  Zwick lets the film drag between inspired moments and the whole film seems  overlong and ponderous, not to mention derivative.  Screenwriter John Logan (Gladiator, The Aviator) borrows one too many plot details from other films that came before him, especially \"Dances With Wolves.\"  One tries to take the film on its own terms, but the similarities are too glaring.  Logan wanted the film to be a classic, but it falls far short.<br /><br />That\'s not to say the film does not have its merits, which why \"The Last Samurai\" is so frustrating to watch.  When it does get good, it\'s breathtaking.  The $120 million production is a visual feast, with beautiful sets juxtaposed seamlessly with sweeping locales in Japan and New Zealand.  The film\'s visual pedigree is furthured by the wondrous cinematography of John Toll.  Toll, a two-time academy award winner, is a master at what he does.  The film is gorgeously shot and the hectically edited battle scenes are given a sense of clarity and extra punch, especially when set to Hans Zimmers\' muscular score.  One only wishes that the reat of the film lived up to this high standard.  It could have been one of the best epics ever.'),(1261,48,'B0001G6PZC','Dallas Buyers Club','Pleasantly Surprised','I\'m a big fan of the samurai films (Toshiro Mifune is my favorate actor pre-1970).

It is a great film that belongs in everyone\'s collection.'),(1262,49,'B0001G6PZC','Dallas Buyers Club','Some good scenes, but not quite credible','The Last Samurai is typical of epic Hollywood war-action/adventure films --impressive scenery, musical score and battle scenes, yet bogged down in cliches and contrived situations. Tom Cruise plays Captain Algren, an 1870s war hero who is tormented by memories of brutal battles against Indians. He is persuaded to travel to Japan to train the army to fight against the samurai, Japan\'s traditional warriors. The Japanese government, motivated by financial reasons, wants to modernize and develop relations with the West; the samurai, who represent Japan\'s noble cultural and warrior heritage, resist these changes. <p>Algren is not given sufficient time to properly train the army in the ways of modern warfare; he is forced to confront the samurai, who defeat the modern army with their discipline and ferocity. This is where the film lost me. Algren himself is only captured after single-handedly fighting off something like a dozen samurai warriors. It is of course a cliche of martial arts movies that the hero can take on countless opponents, but this film is more ambitious and attempts to be realistic, and it is absurd to imagine a man untrained in these traditional martial arts defeating all of these elite warriors with their own weapons. At this point, I was resigned to watching a generic Tom Cruise action hero rather than a believable character.<p>Algren is captured and allowed to recuperate so that the samurai might learn something of their enemy (there had to be some excuse for letting him live). He is even trained in their martial arts, which seems unlikely. Why would they train an enemy combatant? And the time it takes him to learn to fight with their weapons only highlights how unrealistic it was that he was unbeatable in his first battle (where he would more likely have been killed). Algren predictably comes to admire the samurai way of life and eventually sympathizes with their struggle. The film attempts to examine the complex issue of preserving traditions in a rapidly changing world. This is largely expressed in conversations between Algren and a samurai named Katsumoto (well played by Ken Watanabe). A woman named Taka (Koyuki) is the inevitable love interest, as the wife of a man Algren killed in battle. She struggles between her grief and growing fondness for Algren.<p>Although some of the interaction between Algren and Katsumoto is interesting, the film has a basic contradiction that it never really resolves.  It is superficially a sympathetic exploration of a traditional culture, yet at the same time it revels in the stereotype of the Great White Man who travels to distant lands and saves the day, a book and movie tradition that goes back at least as far as Kipling, where British colonists tamed the \"primitive\" people of Africa and Asia. Again, The Last Samurai seems to be more on the side of the colonized, yet this is belied by the huge role played by the Tom Cruise character. <p>Perhaps the most effective scene in the film is the last battle, where we see a rapid-firing cannon mowing down samurai warriors. This image is a stark image of modern society mechanically wiping out a less technologically advanced culture. Unfortunately, I didn\'t find most of the film equal to this theme. I think a better portrayal of a similar story can be found in the miniseries (based on a novel by James Clavell)  Shogun.'),(1263,49,'B0001G6PZC','Dallas Buyers Club','The Last Samurai...Why not Best Picture 2003 ?','After seeing all of the movies nominated for Best Picture 2003, and just watching The Last Samurai last night, I feel that this movie (not to mention its actors)was greatly overlooked by the Academy.

It offers insight into the japanese culture and we, the audience, take it in through the senses of the main character, Nathan Allgren [Tom Cruise]. We learn about the samurai, honor, trust, pursuit of perfection and harmony, discipline and tradition, all adjectives that make Japan what it is today.<br /><br />There are a couple of things however that I personally would have liked to have seen changed. A bit more action and a bit less philosophy and talk [less gab, more shooting one might say].<br /><br />The last scenes of the movie could have definitely done well without the typical hollywood dramatic dialogue and action.

When Tom Cruise was captured in his village, we saw a kind, innocent and pure boy. When he was helping his father to escape, he became brave and determined. I was sad to see him fighting to his death. The diverse sides of this young man were well handled by the actor.

Ngila Dickson definitely deserves her two Oscar nominations, and could have won for either Samurai or ROTK.<p>But Tom Cruise was completely the wrong choice for his character. He is such a modern icon that he simply cannot play a period role.

Subtitles over Hans Zimmer\'s always-great soundtrack wouldn\'t have been a bad choice.'),(1269,50,'B0001G6PZC','Dallas Buyers Club','Fun, but very overrated','I don\'t understand why people take this film so seriously, because I couldn\'t for the life of me. That is not to say the film is altogether bad...it offers some guilty pleasure action sequences, but then again that\'s all it can offer up. Considering what the producers had going into this, they really handled several issues in an amatuer fashion.<p>Let\'s take, for example, just the mere existance of Tom Cruise\'s character in the story. I can understand why Katsumoto spares him - the dream of the white tiger - although I pondered just how readily this culture of people (who only a decade ago murdered any foreign sailors shipwrecked on their island) could accept him so readily. And even then, he probably should have been more of an observer to the Japanese customs than a participant. Miyamoto Musashi spent his whole life realizing how to become a great warrior, but Tom Cruise\'s character manages to do it within six months. And please...you have GOT to be kidding me when he uses not only two swords at once, but two LONG swords at once! Not even the greatest samurai could do that, and there\'s a reason - it\'s practically impossible. And even if it is possible, you\'re telling me Tom Cruise has had that much training to do it? The scene where Katsumoto\'s son takes out a long sword and a short sword is more realistic, as samurai would do that so they could switch from one to the other, but people rarely used katanas in each hand. Oh yes, and I agree with other reviewers here...why does Tom Cruise take six or seven bullets to the torso come out perfectly fine, yet samurai take the same hits and die? <p>The character development for some people needed work as well. For example, the Irish sergeant that is Tom Cruise\'s lifelong friend gets killed by the samurai, and a samurai even gets off his horse and stabs the man in the stomach! Yet Tom Cruise forgets his friend and doesn\'t seem to mind the company of men who killed a man he knew longer than them - in fact we never hear of the Irish sergeant again. And the love story was so unnecessary and unrealistic. Tom Cruise kills the husband of Katsumoto\'s sister, she says to her nephew that he smells like pigs, and then five minutes later she\'s having feelings for him? And she actually falls in love with him, and her kids adore him? Why? Because he taught them baseball? I don\'t know about you, but a person who killed my dad would have to take a bullet for me before I even consider them a friend...let alone my new father. And Tom Cruise\'s old enemy, an American lieutenant colonel he used to serve under, doesn\'t do much except walk around and be evil. And what was the purpose of the ninjas, particularly the guy with the Gorbachev birthmark on his cheek? Why would a government leader so bent on stopping traditionalism employ ninjas, who historically sided with the Shogun...who was a SAMURAI! It\'s almost like they put them in just so they can say, \"Hey! We have ninjas!\"<p>I also took disliking to how INCOMPETANT they made the government characters. When they rescue Katsumoto they use arrows against the guards, which is fine except the guards seem to have a habit of running out into the open with their fronts to the archers, making themselves great targets. Also in the final battle the samurai lay a trap, and the American lieutenant colonel, suggests to send out skirmishers, to which a corrupt government official (who seems to be every where across Japan) simply says, \"No need! Send the troops forward!\" I might also add that the samurai trap for the government troops at the end is planned not by Katsumoto, but by Tom Cruise. Excuse me if I sound like I\'m looking for an arguement, but can\'t the Japanese think on their own? This is the culture that produced Oda Nobunaga, Takeda Shingen, Admiral Togo, and even Admiral Yamamoto, yet it seems in this movie it\'s as if the idea of war is entirely new to them.<p>There are also a lot of historical inaccuracies in this film as well. For example, there was no lone samurai standing up against the government with less than 500 troops. In fact, the majority of samurai clans to the west supported the foreign traders and backed the Emperor. The Satsuma Rebellion in 1860\'s, led by the Satsuma and Chosun samurai clans, was the move to stop foreign intervention...but they at one point had an army as large as 40,000 soldiers. In fact, the army of Japan was fairly modernized by the time set in the film, and it was being led and instructed not by military leaders from America or any other foreign nation, but by fellow Japanese such as Aritomo Yamagata who travelled abroad in Europe studying the ways of the west. The only revolt against the government in 1876/1877 was by former army officer Takamori Saigo - and even though he did want to restore the use of samurai, he could bring up a force of 15,000 against the government and held a fairly modernized army, having served in the professional Japanese military - he also lost not in a grand charge but instead his fortress at Kagoshima. I also find it funny that the movie makes the samurai seem like a noble and proud people built on honor and dignity - they fail to mention according to the traditionalist laws a samurai could kill any peasant and get away with it, being of a higher class. The Emperor himself is portrayed as weak and under the influence of advisors, and while the Emperor was indeed surrounded by advisors and the Japanese government began to fall into an oligarchy, it was Emperor Meiji himself who revoked the samurai of their titles and stripped the Shogun of his power, replacing it more and more to his own stature. He was hardly the weak, indecisive ruler they portrayed in this movie, bending to the will of ONE government agent.<p>Oh yeah, and this has got to be \"Dances With Wolves II: I\'m Turning Japanese.\" I mean come on now, Tom Cruise has experience in both the Civil War and the Indian Wars, and he knows the Indians like he was one. It\'s almost like Kevin Costner\'s character just went to Japan. Story simularities are too easy to spot...white man joins non-white culture, gets in conflict with his own culture and stands up for the little guy. There\'s even a romantic interest with a member of the non-white culture! Seriously...I was joking when I said this looked like \"Dances With Wolves,\" but after seeing this movie I realized just how right I was.<p>Well...um...as you can see, I had a \"few\" problems with the film. I\'d have to say I would almost give it 2.5 stars, but like I said there is some guilty pleasure action in it, but I don\'t consider it the greatest film ever like many called it. I had fun watching it, but I found it to be INCREDIBLY overrated. To toy with a history and culture like this may have been good for a smaller, less-known nation - but Japan\'s history has a good place in the hearts of many, and she is a major nation on the international scene. Watch this film if you like Tom Cruise or you just want to see some action. Don\'t watch it expecting an American version of a Kurosawa film like people are trying to make it out to be, because you will be disappointed.

Tom Cruise does a good job protraying a guilt-ridden American warrior who was reborn as samurai warrior. It probably helped that his co-star Ken Watanabe proves to be a superior actor and he probably pushed Cruise to the higher level of acting once they began to shared scenes together. On the whole, the movie will worked for most people watching it because it gives a very idealistic look at the Japanese samurai culture at its best.<p>However, most of it proves to be pure historical fantasy at its best. You should never considered that this was the way it was back in Japan of 1876. Outdated armor and thinking are not the way of the Samurai. Samurai, like all warrior types, adjust and adapt to changing warfare. Anyone who even know a thing about the warring period of 1540 to 1615 understand that samurai went from bow and arrow to firearms proficiently very quickly. Where the movie take a major misstep is that while the spirit and teaching of the samurai is tradition based, fighting modes are not.<p>But this is a Hollywood movie made for American taste and perception. This is how many Americans see the samurai warriors of the old and just the way the many foreigners see American history as one of wars between cowboys and Indians or black folks tipping their hats to the white folks, this movie catered to best of the sternotypes. There is nothing truly historical about this film. The movie was made in the same mode as Mel Gibson\'s Patriot and Braveheart, all entertainment but no history.<p>Now this movie have been compared with Dances with Wolves and there seem to be some justice to that comparsion. Both shows how a lone white man surrounded by an alien culture, \"went native\" so to speak and aligned himself with that culture. Both movies introduced these alien cultures through that white man\'s perception and his inevitable acceptance and entrance to that culture.

I have a home theater (my screen is over 9 feet wide!) so I need HD, otherwise images look just \"ok\", as opposed to \"spectacular\", the way this movie does.

During the first battle against the Samurai, Algren is taken captive and forced to remain in an isolated Samurai village. There, he learns the enigmatic ways of the Samurai and comes to love their unique brand of civilization. He then switches sides and fights along side the Samurai and against his former peers.<br /><br />\"The Last Samurai\" is a gentle, caring study of how modern society often tramples over ways of the past without even flinching. The film showcases beautiful cinematography and expert pacing. However, it is not without its flaws. The acting is hit-and-miss. Tom Cruise and Tony Goldwyn deliver average performances, while Ken Watanabe is quite exceptional as the peaceful leader of the Samurai village. The film, while excellent, also does have its share of clich&eacute;s, such as a shaky slow motion scene where Algren remembers the massacre that haunts him. There are also a few moments where you have to wonder if director Edward Zwick is kind of trying to tug at your strings (to release the waterworks, that is).<br /><br />But flaws aside, \"The Last Samurai\" is a film people should most certainly see. The social commentary is very relevant to modern society and the blend of beautiful scenic backdrops and violent battle sequences make this film truly stand out amongst a sea of stinkers such as \"Troy\".<br /><br />8/10'),(1278,1,'B0001G6PZC','Dallas Buyers Club','Likable, but Lacks Originality','The Last Samurai is a story about a Civil War veteran who goes over to Japan to fight the last pocket of Samurai; he is taken captive by the Samurai, but eventually learns to respect this dying culture and adapt to their way of life.<br /><br />WHAT WORKS: The movie is beautiful to look at; the cinemtography is magnificent. The story is generally engrossing and it\'s great to envision how the Samurai may have really lived in Japan hundreds of years ago. Speaking of which, the costumes and sets are outstanding, no doubt about it.<br /><br />WHAT DOESN\'T WORK: I enjoyed the movie, I did, but the plot is obviously taken from \"Dances With Wolves,\" a very superior film. One could also cite \"Lawrence of Arabia\" and \"Last of the Dogmen\" as films with similar plots. (Although \"Dogmen\" is basically a rip-off of \"Dances With Wolves,\" the story takes place in the modern world, so it definitely possesses its own uniqueness). The scene in \"Samurai\" where the Samurai make their first dramatic appearance is obviously ripped-off straight from a similar scene in \"Dogmen\" wherein the Indians make their first appearance (compare the two scenes for verification).<br /><br />The score in the film is certainly serviceable but parts of it painfully sound like a watered-down variation of the fabulous score from \"The Last of the Mohicans.\"<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: Although \"The Last Samurai\" could be subtitled \"Dances with the Last Dogmen of Arabia,\" it\'s still quite enjoyable. People who have not seen these other four movies that so-obviously influenced \"Samurai\" will likely rate \"The Last Samurai\" higher than I have. If you really like this film and haven\'t seen these other movies I\'ve mentioned, I encourage you to pick \'em up ASAP -- especially \"The Last of the Mohicans\" and \"Dances With Wolves,\" which are two of the best movies ever filmed, period.'),(1279,1,'B0001G6PZC','Dallas Buyers Club','Better than I expected','When I first heard about this movie I was sceptical.

White man is hired to destroy foreign culture, white man falls in love with culture, white man fights on the side of the culture he was supposed to destroy....same plot essentially right?

In some ways though I love the ending the most.  I know a lot of people were pissed off by it, but here\'s how I look at it.  You have to listen to the narration--no one knows what really happened.  That final scene--in my opinion--is only what the british linguist wants to believe happened to his friend.  As for Tom Cruise surviving, well again the narration points out that many people think he died of his injuries.  He may have made it off that battle field, but he didn\'t do it easily.  Also, somone pointed out that if he really believed the Samuri code he would have killed himself.  A) I think he owed it to Katsumoto to bring the Emperor his sword, and tell the emperor what took place.  The whole point of that battle was to send a message to the emperor, and it was a message that needed at least one person to drive it home.  B)Anyone who thinks he should have just killed himself misses the fact that he isn\'t samuri.  He\'s a melding of two cultures.  Even after all he\'d been through, I think that remains true.'),(1284,2,'B0001G6PZC','Dallas Buyers Club','Tom Cruise plays somone other than himself','This is an interesting role for tom Cruise. Many times, you\'ll see him playing himself in films - by that I mean, you never quite lose the line between him and his character.<br /><br />And that works for him.<br /><br />In this film, you get a glimpse of how he is learning to transcend his own character and lose himself more fully in his roles. As he matures as an actor, and not just a blockbuster draw, I really think those kinds of transformations are going to be his best asset.<br /><br />The story in the film is touching and ironic, and is respectful of all the cultures represented within it. Are they accurate portrayals? That depends on which side of the lens you\'re on.'),(1285,3,'B0001G6PZC','Dallas Buyers Club','Decent but no Kurosawa','Edward Zwick directs this 2003 film on a historical incident involving an American military advisor sent to Japan to modernize and train the ruling emperor\'s forces in 1876-1877. This is your typical Hollywood revised history where actual dramatic events are diluted with your conventional PC script and mandatory vapid love story.  Although the film has a decent cast with good direction and cinemtography, it\'s bogged down by a generic Hollywood screenplay and poor script.<br /><br />Retired Captain Nathan Algren (Tom Cruise) is fed up with the US Army and the Indian Wars.  Approached by a fellow veteran and nemesis (Tony Goldwyn), Algren accepts a lucrative offer to train the Emperor of Japan\'s forces along the modern standards of 1875.  Arriving in Japan, Algren\'s informed that the Emperor\'s traditional samurai warriors and their leader (Ken Watanabe) oppose all attempts to modernize Japan.  Believing that firearms are cowardly weapons, the samurai hold true to their Bushido code and continue to fight with their traditional weapons.  Disillusioned with his shame of the Indian wars he fought back home and eager to redeem his honor, Algren becomes enamoured with the ethos of Samurai warriors and so decides to join them for a final stand.<br /><br />This was a good story that just never seemed to soar.  This is mostly due to a generic and predictable formulaic Hollywood script with cliche dialogue.  Does every drama have to conclude with an out-of-place happy romantic sub-plot to the likes of a 90210 episode?  Although a film about samurai warriors, the film only pays lip service to the teachings of the Bushido code with quick scenes of warriors committing hara-kiri and hardened Japanese men sitting stoically on their knees drinking sake. The dialogue is contrived and superficial: exploring only the surface of the Bushido code and Japanese culture.<br /><br />In conclusion, the film is decent but comes far short of the epic it could have been.  Here, a great story was hampered by the inclusion of conventional modern plots that are at odds with the historical drama covered by the film.  The acting was decent but not terribly memorable due to a rather contrived script.  For a true rendition of the samurai code and feudal Japan, I would recommend films by Akira Kurosawa instead such as \'Ran\', \'Kagemusha\', or \'The Seven Samurai.\''),(1286,3,'B0001G6PZC','Dallas Buyers Club','I can\'t believe you don\'t own this already!','I cannot say enough good things about this movie so I will try to keep it short.

I do not want to say much more about the story, unlike some other reviewers, because it is impossible to tell as well as the film does. I will just say that this epic and beautfully written tale leaves you with a whole new respect for what samurais have done for the legend of Japan.<br /><br />  Tom Cruise is simply phenomenal! This is his best performance on the silver screen by far. Also, his co-star Ken Watanabe who plays the leader of the samurai is better than your highest expectaions. As for the fighting, there are many great scenes that range from sword training to being raided by ninjas to the final bloody battle that can stand up to any other ever filmed.  Speaking of blood, the special effects are outstanding and the sound is excellent, they really bring the action to life.

Times are a-changing in the Land of the Rising Sun: in the fervour of the Meiji Restoration, everything Western is very much &quot;in&quot; which, sadly, means that the game\'s up for the country\'s samurai, who have kept the nation in a vicegrip for the past few centuries. Some, however, aren\'t willing to go down without a fight, and so it is that Algren finds himself, in command of a motley and ill-trained force, facing-off against rogue samurai leader Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe). Suffice to say that things don\'t go entirely as planned, and Algren finds himself defeated and taken hostage by Katsumoto\'s samurai band. His captivity, though, proves to be the source of his redemption, as he adopts the customs of the samurai and ultimately joins them in their final stand against the Imperial forces.<br />It\'s all a bit Dances With Wolves but, although The Last Samurai isn\'t in the same league as that movie, it remains an engaging and watchable, albeit flawed, epic. Those hoping for an authentic depiction of pre-modern Japan should look elsewhere (Akira Kurosawa\'s films, and the recent Twilight Samurai, would be good places to start) - this is samurai culture re-tailored for a Hollywood audience. The samurai are depicted as peace-loving folk, with no reference made to the crushing feudal regime they imposed; meanwhile, Watanabe\'s Katsumoto, despite being vehemently opposed to the Western forces encroaching on his beloved country, speaks fluent English - a tad ridiculous, to say the least. The idyllic village to which Cruise\'s character is whisked away looks more like something out of Lord of the Rings - indeed, much of The Last Samurai was filmed in New Zealand; the country vistas look nothing like Japan, past or present.<br />All of this didn\'t stop the film from winning-over much of the native audience here, mind you, leaving only us gaijin to scoff at the inconsistencies. When you compare it to the likes of Braveheart and Gladiator, too, it starts to feel a little unfair to chastise The Last Samurai for the numerous historical liberties it takes. Hey, at least the Japanese characters actually speak some Japanese.<br />If you can overlook the inaccuracies (and I\'m sure the average viewer would be happy to), The Last Samurai is a pretty entertaining watch. Cruise turns in a decent performance - moody, strained, with the faintest whiff of trying-too-hard - but it\'s Watanabe who provides the most compelling screen presence. His Katsumoto is a dignified, commanding figure, whose commitment to the ancient Bushido samurai code (which, with its &quot;let\'s rush headlong towards a bloody and unnecessary death!&quot; mantra, is more than a little unpalatable to Western audiences) seems utterly believable. Director Edward Zwick comes up with some exhilirating set pieces, too: the final battle is well-staged, but it\'s a ninja assault on Katsumoto\'s village midway through the film that leaves the most lasting impression.<br />The Last Samurai is by no means a great movie: it\'s too long by far, the introduction of a love interest is painfully contrived, and - crucially - it doesn\'t pack the emotional punch that Kevin Costner managed in Dances With Wolves. The death of the samurai culture was, let\'s face it, neither as tragic nor as unfair as that of the Native Americans - Zwick and co may try to have us believe otherwise, but it\'s a disingenuous pitch, to say the least.

Tom Cruise is great in this role and is quite possibily his best role yet.  Algren is sent to Japan by America to train the Imperial Japanese army in the way of Western warfare and weaponry.  This sets up the confrontation between the Samurai, who are defending their dying culture, and Algren, who is trying to destroy that culture.

Tom brings a suitably tortured mein to the role as a late 1870\'s army captain fresh off the Indian wars of the west.  Brought over to Japan to ostensibly modernize their army and remove the vestiges of the samurai caste he is quickly captured and spends the rest of the movie going through a `Dances with Wolves\' transformation into a gaijin warrior.  Despite the simplistic plot, the movie is delivered with a great earnestness and sense of purpose.  Watanabe is at once fierce and serene as the lead samurai, [was he a daimyo or in the service of one?].  This film hints at the beauty and depth of bushido, trying to make it understandable to the western sensibility.  I have a great love for Japanese culture, history, and aesthetics; and this film managed to mix in some wonderful examples of those.

LOL<br />The movie is loosely based on the &quot;Satsuma Rebellion&quot; which took place in 1876-77 when a bunch of aging Samurai decided to take a last stand against the new Meiji Government. The Samurai fought well but eventually went extinct. The Last Samurai is a good movie though, in a world with a lack of Samurai flicks.'),(1294,6,'B0001G6PZC','Dallas Buyers Club','Fantasy','This film is a fantasy, pure and simple, beyond just the addition of a white American to the rebel samurai ranks.  This is not necessarily a problem if the movie-goer is seeking out something other than historical drama, but the viewer should keep him/herself more in mind of \"The Lord of the Rings\" than of \"Lawrence of Arabia\" when watching it.<br />Katsumoto\'s deference to the Emperor is the driving force for his character, but the real samurai had no tradition of loyalty to him.  In fact, the samurai only came full-force onto the pages of history by, in effect, overthrowing the Emperor in the 12th century and usurping his power.  It wasn\'t until the beginning of the Meiji Era (the time in which this film is set) that the Emperor regained any real control at all, and it was his choice to \"modernize\" Japan (Army and all) out of a justified fear of European colonization and/or exploitation.  Of course, by this time the samurai had lived under centuries of isolationist peace, and had long since ceased to be warriors.  They had become the powerful hereditary nobles and bureaucrats of Japan, more akin to Cicero than Caesar, and it was not the creation of the Army that bothered most of them, but the new laws forbidding them to wear swords- the symbols of their status- in an attempt at abolition of the (deeply inefficient and unprofitable) nobility system.<br />Nevertheless, the character of Katsumoto is indeed based on a real person, and the film on real events.  But the those who revolted were, first, a tiny minority of the samurai who continued to live by (or re-adopted) the old lifestyle; and, second, at war over the threat to their accumulated clout, rather than over some perception of Japan \"losing its way\".  Their actions were nothing more than a naked power-grab.<br />The storied traditions of the samurai largely came to an end (as much as they ever existed) when Tokugawa Ieyasu came to power at the beginning of the 17th century.<br />(As a side note, the scene with the ninja was the one part of the film I found truly outlandish.  Video games aside, ninja are not readily apparent in Japan.  There is little mention of them in history; they were not, and are not, especially respected or admired; and Japanese people on the whole cannot fathom the young American male\'s obsession with them.  There is no matching fervor on the other side of the Pacific.  What is common knowledge, however, is that at no time would dozens of them work together or get themselves caught up in an all-out attack, nor would a government trying to \'modernize\' employ them.  Since they made their living on contracts against noblemen\'s belongings, most of decent society looked on them with more contempt than Europeans showed the most fearsome pirates).<br />The portrayal of Japan and, specifically, samurai \"society\" in this film is the Western romantic version- like Mallory\'s portrayal of medieval knights and the Chivalric Code in \"L\'Morte D\'Arthur\".  This does not make the film entirely without merit.  The cinematography is gorgeous, and I would happily watch the film again for that alone.  The acting is fairly strong.  I personally think Tom Cruise is an excellent actor, when he chooses a good role (like in \"Rain Man\", \"Eyes Wide Shut\", and others), and he performs adequately here.  However, it is far from his best work, and I think it was a correct decision for the Academy not to honor him with a nomination this year.<br />Perhaps part of the problem with the performance was a problem with the characters.  Most were rather typical of the genre known as \"epic\", and I could guess what they were going to say before the words were out of their mouths.  The story itself was easily predictable, but plot twists are not the reason most people will come to see this film.<br />Altogether, I can best describe the movie as \"fun\".  I find it enjoyable in the same way as I do anything from \"Terminator 2\" to \"Sleepless in Seattle\".

I didn\'t know how deep it would try and be, or how good the storyline or action was. I may hear people complain about a few plot holes, but give the movie a break, guys. This is definitely one of Tom Cruise\'s best outings. One of his most emotional performances is given here. Ken Watanabe is astounding as the leader of the samurai clan that take Civil War vet Capt. Nathan Aulgren (Cruise) into their clan as a P.O.V. but he eventually learns to like their culture and becomes a samurai himself. The landscape of the movie is beautiful, and Hans Zimmer\'s score plays gloriously in the background.<br />  The movie really makes you eventually hate the &quot;modern&quot; enemy of a modernized Japan, with a fully-equipped legion of American-trained soldiers, Nathan\'s old enemy from back home, and the leader of the new brand of soldiers. This leads to an all-out war between the samurai and the new Japan and it is an incredible scene when these two go at it, definitely one of my favorite movie war scenes of all-time.<br />  The DVD is a fully-loaded 2 disc-set, boasting impressive video quality and audio quality on the first one with 2.35:1 and Dolby Digital 5.1 soundtrack (I would\'ve liked a DTS though), and impressive special features on the second disc that further immerse you in the world of old Japan.<p>  Definitely a very powerful, albeit a bit fictitious, film. Spoiler coming up--------<p>we all know Tom Cruise died on the battlefield.'),(1321,2,'B0001G6PZC','Dallas Buyers Club','Epic Yet Intimate Portrait of Old Japan','The Last Samurai is one of the best movies I have ever seen.  It was a blockbuster smash in Japan.  It tells the story of the Samurai of Japan and how they became obsolete due to westernization of their country.  Although the last scene with the emperor concerning his decision whether to fully open Japan to the West is pure fiction, the rest is generally accurate.  The director seeks to romanticize the samurai.  The samurai traditions and culture are not that difficult to romanticize.  Everything they stood for is portrayed in the film.  Watching it, you yearn to add these values to your own life, and feel achingly their loss to today\'s society.  This is the true value of the film - to raise the samurai once again, in their full glory of life, and the strange glory of their deaths.<p>The climactic scene of the final battle between the samurai and the new army is predictable, yet still horrifying.  You just wish it could end differently.  Tom Cruise and Ken Watanabe are glorious.  Watanabe received a Best Supporting Actor nomination.  I feel The Last Samurai should have received more nominations, and at least one Oscar.<p>In real life, the last of the samurai did indeed perish in a last-stand battle against the new military.  They were led by a samurai general who died in the battle.  He is now a hero in Japanese legend and culture.'),(1322,4,'B0001G6PZC','Dallas Buyers Club','very good','This is a very entertaining movie. good action, good scenery and good story.

The story, though not new, is very tightly woven.  From the epic scenery of Japan(wow!) to the battles scenes(double wow!), this movie shows nothing but grace througout it\'s 2 1/2 hours.  The romance was refreshing and beautiful as there are no nudity or sexual scenes that hollywood soo depends on to get ratings(or points across).  How powerful it is to just see plain human emotion show by one\'s ever so slight movement and gestures.  Incredible.  The Asian actors, Ken Watanabe, Hiroyuki Sanada, and Koyuki(gorgeous in all graceful forms) all deserve nominations as I rarely see such inspiring performances.  Everything you\'d expect in a grand adventure from director Edward Zweck.  The music by Hans Zimmer is truly deserving.  Though not as \"Japanese\" as some reviewers stated, I truly felt heart motivated through his symphonic composition for the battle scenes.  I\'m sorry, should I instead state \"awe inspired\"!  So sit back, relax and enjoy something that only comes out once in awhile.  If you like this, perhaps you\'ll also enjoy a Japanese animation that\'s called \"samurai X: trust, and samurai X:betrayal\".  <p>For those who disliked this movie or criticized it for being \"tom cruised\" or \"not historically accurate\", try watching with an open mind.  I usually go watch movies to be inspired, love, hate, feel through them, not to point out every flaw I see.'),(1325,7,'B0001G6PZC','Dallas Buyers Club','Good action flick, so-so epic','This movie is a good one, but it could have been much better. If you go in expecting a period action piece, you will not be disappointed. Those expecting something along the line of \"Braveheart\" be warned. Tom Cruise is enjoyable, but he gives his standard performance. Which is to say that you do not see a character like he is capable of giving, such as Ron Kovic in \"Born on the 4th of July\" or even Lestat in \"Interview with the Vampire.\" Instead you get Tom Cruise as an angst-ridden, recovering alcoholic that looks great in a kimono. But the performance still works, it\'s just shame about the missed potential.<br />Ken Watanabe is very charismatic as the traditionalist-turned-outlaw who tries to hold on to the outdated beliefs of the samurai. The chemistry between he and Cruise is very good and it\'s one of the more pleasurable aspects of the film. As well as the much too short screen time of Billy Conelly and Tony Goldwyn. The cinematography and the costumes are also great and are bound to get oscar nominations.<p>Unfortunately this film buys into it\'s own granduer, and it falls short on that level. There are some great moments in the film, don\'t get me wrong. Edward Zwick proves he can still crank out a battle scene and he clearly outdoes himself in the last battle of the film. Even when you know what the outcome will be. But that\'s where the film should have ended. Instead you get another ten minutes of an eye rolling, very sappy resolution. I\'m not sure if this was the product of Zwick or the suits at WB, but does not work.<br />Another scene I found difficult to swallow was an assassination attempt. Great fight choreography, great action, but awkwardly placed and no justification for it. You can almost hear a studio exec say \"This is Japan. So where are the ninjas?\" If the gunpowder obsessed emperor and cronies sent the assassins, (which is whom you assume sent them) why did they use ninjas instead of rifleman? Thereby proving the effectiveness of rifle over swords. It\'s because it makes for a great action scene, that\'s why, and the audience will eat it up.<p>The film is good and I recommend it. But be warned that at times it comes across as very contrived. I was hoping for an epic, instead I got a really good action flick. Three stars instead four due to studio induced Oscar pandering'),(1326,7,'B0001G6PZC','Dallas Buyers Club','A goof!','There is a goof during the battle scene with the ninjas: the scene where Cruise is on the ground with a ninja on top of him trying to push him into the sword - the part when the kid (I forget his name) picka up a sword and fights the other ninja. Watch Cruise on the ground. He gets the ninja off of him, and the next time it shows him still on the ground with the ninja on him!'),(1327,9,'B0001G6PZC','Dallas Buyers Club','Tightly Done Historical Action Piece','I was surprised that I actually liked this one, particularly since it seemed to promise just another run-of-the-mill action/adventure period piece. Of course I happen to be partial to these kinds of stories and I have a great fondness for the Japanese variants of same. Still I didn\'t expect to enjoy this hybrid eastern-western that reworked Japanese history in order to put a dissolute and despondent American war hero (who\'s tortured by what he did in the Indian wars that followed on the Civil War) into the era of Japanese modernization. Tom Cruise always seems to me to be too cuddly to play such roles and yet I thought he pulled this one off. The story held together and was absorbing if somewhat predictable while Cruise actually proved to be a somewhat convincing American dissolute. That he takes to the Samurai lifestyle and weapons handling practices so readily is a bit hard to believe though the film does a good job of dragging out the learning process enough so that it doesn\'t look too precipitous. Of course, the American is only with his captors for a few months so it\'s a little hard to accept that he manages to become expert in Japanese swordsmanship in so short a span. But the film makes it look convincing and that\'s usually enough in this kind of thing. The battle scenes are also nicely done and the Samurai lord, Katsuomoto, who captures and ultimately befriends the American Algren is powerfully portrayed. Although there was little that was unexpected, Katsoumoto\'s escape from his enemies at the emperor\'s court was probably the high point and the least predictable in the film\'s repertoire of scenes. I\'d see this one again for its ambience and tight storytelling, even if it didn\'t ultimately swallow me up, which, on my view, is the true measure of a great film.<br /><br />SWM<br />author of The King of Vinland\'s Saga'),(1328,10,'B0001G6PZC','Dallas Buyers Club','It just can\'t be any better','The guys wrote a lot of good stuff in other reviews and i\'m not gonna add any more except my HIGH appreciation and recommendations to this movie.

Its hardhitting impact is intense enough to keep audiences\' eyes wide open through the whole movie.  Its written plot of a US soldier changing his life for the better in Japan is brilliant.  Despite the war themes, there are some great heartwarming scenes, namely when the US soldier starts healing his pains from his US war battles.  As he begins learning Japanese traditions, he begins learning more about himself, which plays a crutial part in the film.  As this develops, the drama also develops, which keeps audiences interested.  This allows the conflicts between the two sides to be brought out as brilliantly as it was.  His friends\' life stories add an additional unique flavor.  The war scenes are uniquely intense.  Few other movies have thought of such original war scenery.  This teaches audiences that there is no one way to fight a war or to solve a conflict. <p>Its Oscar-nominated 1870\'s Japanese setting is flawless.  They prove that they did their research to construct such an elaborate set.  The war scenes are desplicted as brutal as they should thanks to the special effects.  The costumes are accurate from those times.  Such great background offers an improved sense of this masterpiece film.<p>Tom Cruise\'s underrated role as US soldier Nathan Algren is his best in years.  His two years of training to prepare for his role paid off.  He never loses his intense sense of emotion for a second.  The pain and agony expressed are as pure as if he actually lived it.  Ken Watanabe\'s Oscar-nominated role as Samarai leader Katsumoto rightfully places him in the spotlight.  This performance makes acting appear easy when it\'s actually the opposite.  He proves that he will become a big-name actor in the next following years.  All other actors also performed their roles beautifully.<p>\"The Last Samarai\" is great for those looking for a unique war movie with emotion.  This is sure to please many audiences.

Fully believable, and very in tune with the Japanese culture that I was exposed to while living there.<p>Clearly a previous reviewer didn\'t watch the film carefully.  The main character was never officially made a samurai; however, he was exposed to eastern philosophies in a gentle, very authentic, eastern philosophy way.  The main character learned about mindlessness, mindfulness, and other tennants of Buddhism, but overall the main theme of this epic was HONOR.  Honor in living, honor in battle, and honor in death.  <p>Young teens and older children could watch this field, because it lacks the graphic violence and sexuality as I mentioned before.

And Bushido (translated to, \"way of the warrior\").  What place do these hold in life and all it encompasses.  Warner Bros. \"The Last Samurai\" attempts to depict the epic and time age tale of traditional norms versus a new and modernizing society.<p>The story takes place in Japan.  However, not Japan as we know it today, but just as it was emerging from its bloody, feudal cradle.  A feudal bloodbath entailing Japanese ways of life no more than 150 years ago.<p>\"The Last Samurai\" begins with a Japanese empirical advisor who needs the samurai eliminated in order to finish his railroad.  At first the samurai are viewed as imperial rebeliests; \"barbarians\" with no sense of what is right and wrong.  The advisor hires an American Civil War veteran, Nathan Algren (Tom Cruise), and for $500 a month he trains a small army of men to fight the samurai.  But when the samurai attack a railroad construction village the advisor becomes impatient and orders Cruise\'s superior officer Colonel Benjamin Bagly (Tony Goldwyn) to lead the small and unprepared force against the samurai.  The skilled and experienced samurai easily overpower the unpolished army and take Cruise as their prisoner.  Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe) the group leader of the samurai, along with other agendas, wishes to \"know his enemy.\"<p>Cruise eventually grows to love the simplicity and stillness of the samurai way of life.  He adopts the concept of Bushido (Japanese for \"way of the warrior\"); a theme that flows compassionately throughout the film.  Over the course of a year he learns samurai ways, their fighting methods, and even eventually begins to learn their language. But when his new found life is threatened by the old, he chooses to fight with the men he once considered his enemy.<p>Tom Cruise plays Nathan Algren, a downtrodden Civil War veteran who douses his troubles in alcohol.  He suffers from flashbacks that give Cruise\'s character a sense of shame and weariness.  And while Cruise\'s performance is exceptional even he cannot take precedence over the grandeur and scope of what \"The Last Samurai\" does symbolize.  The death of an era, and the usherance of technological assimilation.<p>Asian actors Ken Watanabe (Katsumoto), and Koyuki (Taka), play their roles brilliantly; and while their dialogue is not as numerous as Cruise\'s, their actions speak for more than themselves.  Katsumoto, is a proud, thoughtful, and an integrible samurai leader.  For more than 900 years he and his ancestors have protected the ways and honor of his people.  He and Cruise periodically converse in philosophical meetings sprinkled with humor.  Taka shines as Cruise\'s caretaker.  However, very early in the movie we find out that Taka is a widow of a samurai that Cruise has killed in battle; an enigma that lends a sense of depth and responsibility to both characters roles throughout the movie.<p>Perhaps one of the more historical points is the weakness of the Japanese Emperor, Meiji, played by Scichinosuke Nakamura.  At this point of Japan\'s history, the Emperor became more of a figurehead, controlled by a group of economist advisors only wishing to fatten their wallets.  But this is portrayed in more of a symbolic matter throughout \"The Last Samurai.\"<p>Both the complexity and simplicity of \"The Last Samurai,\" enjoy ubiquity throughout the film.  There is never a moment in which both must not be weighed equally.  With every scene there is a sense of duty and honor, while there is at the same time enjoyment in the stillness of life.  A concoction of artsy filmography and articulating background music allow the plot to encompass all aspects of the movie; never will a moment take precedence over the plot or all that it strives to facilitate.  The facts of the matter are perhaps best but in a quote from the movie:<p>Algren:  \"Life in every breath . . .\"<br />Katsumoto:  \"That is Bushido\"<p>All in all I would have to say \"The Last Samurai\" will be going on my all time favorite list.  Never have a watched a movie with such compassion and dedication towards one fervor.  Every fight scene is not without purpose, and a message.  And the action does not sway the viewer from the movie\'s ultimate and undeniable essence.<p>Several comparisons by other film critics have compared the movie to \"Lawrence of Arabia,\" and \"Dances with Wolves,\" in which the westerner becomes infatuated and then eventually assimilated into the natural culture; I even noticed several parallels to \"Glory,\" which was also directed by Edward Zwick.  And while these aspects may have lended something to the movie, simply enjoy it for what it is; volumes could be written on the parallels to Akira Kurusawa\'s \"Seven Samurai.\" No matter how many similarities there may be, there are just as many original concepts to be beheld.<p>The only one complaint I have is the \"Hollywood\" ending.  Hauntingly familiar to \"Dances with Wolves,\" it was ending that did not seem befitting of such a cinematic masterpiece.  However, I would have to say that it is worthy of any notable DVD collection.<p>After the movie was over and the credits began their usual scroll, I noticed that nearly half the people in the audience sat there while the other half stood and enjoyed the music.  I would like to think that they remained in deep contemplation and awe of all that this movie put into essence.

It is brilliant and poignant, with emotional and brilliant performances by Tom Cruise, Ken Watanabe, and the rest of the cast. Tom Cruise is Captain Nathan Algren, a man who is conflicted by the past by a very serious incident that happened during the Civil War. He is offered a job in Japan, where he is going to train the emperor\'s soldiers. But, when they are pulled into combat early, that is when during the soldiers\' first attack that Algren is captured by the Samurai and kept alive by Katsumoto, played by Ken Watanabe. That he is where he learns about his enemy and gets enlightened by them and decides to stay with them. Timothy Spall plays Simon Graham, a translator and photographer who is with Algren in this magnificent journey. Billy Connolly plays Zebulon Gant, a dear friend of Algren. Tony Goldwyn plays Colonel Bagley, a comrade and enemy of Algren\'s. This is a brilliant movie with a powerful story and a powerful word about how you look at things and you think at what they should be. Edward Zwick\'s directing is brilliant. The costume design by Ngila Dickson is splendid. The production design by Lilly Kilvert is incredibly beautiful. The film editing by Steven Rosenblum and Victor du Bois is excellent. The cinematography by John Toll is brilliant. The music by Hans Zimmer is powerful and brilliantly excellent.

When I was checking this out, thought the lousy idea is there, \"The Last Samurai\" actually executes into a well-productive and impressive film to see.<p>This film start off with the handsome actor as Nathan Algren, a wasted Civil War veteran grieving over his bloody memories of that war, being sent to the land of the rising sun by authorities of two nations in order to train Bigwig soldiers how to fight against the \'antagonists\'.  During his first battle of Nihhon Civil War, he lost, and instead of being killed dishonerably by the oppositioners, they took him to their turf, a really nice and solitude turf.  Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe), the head village chief and captain of his soldiers, decides to use him to know more on his enemies\' new weapondrym and later builds a strong partnership with Algren, that which is Cruise, to stop them.<p>Since I realized this isn\'t based on a true story, I knew that this movie would go by-the-numbers and there would be some easy-to-recognize foreshadowing moments. Hey, this is an epic movie; Epic = violence, betrayal, love, and honor. Actually, the formula works in high numbers for this flick.  Knowing how Algren mourned over the massacre in a native-american village his men caused many years ago, and how he was adjust to a Japanese village while he was captured was intriguing, especially when he knows much about the Japanese culture: how the people were respectable though silly like normal people, be spiritually intertwine, understand nature, and aware about life and death, even children must know about it; man, now I can understand why death is acceptable in Japanese animation.  Adding Aldren knowing the hidden samurai spirit within, and the whole plotting structure makes this raw sushi well-done.<p>Great as it seems, on the less greener side, the movie doesn\'t  have a certain ingenuity that makes it inspiring and feels like it plays a big role in the movie industry and in our hearts.  The movie is very emotional and breathtaking, but it\'s not exactly thought-provoking.  Breathtaking is what I like to say the most on the movie\'s production value: good selection of cast, above-par acting, wonderful musical score, and battles mixed with somewhat-noticeable special effects that really build up an adreneline rush.<p>\'The Seven Samurai\', this movie is so not at its league, but \"The Last Samurai\" is a great epic film to watch.  It\'s not profound, but it\'s still compelling in many ways.  Samurai films like this should be made more, nowadays.'),(1340,8,'B0001G6PZC','Dallas Buyers Club','A Truly Touching Film','This film is definately on the top of my favorite movie list. Tom Cruise does a beautiful job portraying a Civil War veteran that is having a lot of difficulty accepting what occured in his past. He goes to Japan for a job of training a modern Japanese army fighting the last of the samurai that are rebeling against the ways of the government, but still fighting for the emperor. He ends up becoming a part of the warriors he was training to kill, and so begins the epic tale of Nate Algren. A memorable line that the charecter Nathan Algren states at the beginning of the movie is this: You want me to kill Jappos, I\'ll kill Jappos.<br />Colonel Bagley: I\'m not asking you to kill anybody.<br />Algren: &quot;You want me to kill THE ENEMIES of Jappos, I\'ll kill THE ENEMIES of Jappos... Rebs, The Souix, The Cheyenne... For $500 a month I\'ll kill whoever you want. But keep one thing in mind, I\'d gladly kill you for free.&quot; Really makes you wanna hang around this guy, huh? The acting is amazing, Ken Watanbe plays a cool headed philosopher type samurai that has interesting and touching ideas. This movie is definatly one that is worth seeing. For sure a five star movie.'),(1341,8,'B0001G6PZC','Dallas Buyers Club','Great story and visually stunning','I didn\'t have high expectations for this movie, but it surprised and pleased me enough to watch it 3 times.  I\'ve always like Tom Cruise and he doesn\'t disappoint in this movie.  But the real star is Ken Watanabe as the Samurai leader-what perfect casting! And Koyuki as the Samurai widow was just plain gorgeous.  The HD DVD transfer made an already beautiful movie that much better.  Highly recommended.'),(1342,9,'B0001G6PZC','Dallas Buyers Club','Good film with fantastic imagery','I wasnt certain what to expect from \"The Last samurai\". The fact that Cruise and long time collaborator Paula Wagner co-produced this film made me wonder if this was just another action vehicle for Tom to flex his dramatic chops. Having seen the film I hav to say I was pleasantly surprised. Cruise shows he has grown as an actor although I must admit I still see Tom CRuise and not the character he is playing.<br /><br />The plot has been decribed in other reviews so I need not elaborate here. what I will say is that the cinematography of this film was breathtaking. The scenes of rural Japan were gorgeous. I was particulalrly impressed with the recreation of the Japanese harbor circa 1876 with a bustling Japanese port and a majestic mount fuji looming in the distance.<br /><br />The actors were all particularly great, especially Ken Watanabe who plays the rebelious(?)samurai Katsumoto. His presence on screen was commanding and his ability to be stern and understanding really worked. You cant help but feel for the inner turmoil his character endures.<br /><br />Overall \"the last samurai\" was a fantastic film with great acting and some great imagery. I felt Algren\'s inner conflict could have been fleshed out more and we could have a better understanding of why Katsumoto\'s view of life was preferable to Algren than the viewpoint of the new Japanese government.<br /><br />Good film , RECOMMENDED!'),(1343,9,'B0001G6PZC','Dallas Buyers Club','truly heroic','Congratulations Ton Cruise you have finally made a film I can watch without wanting to punch you in the middle of your smug face, you took a back seat for once and let more talented actors have the stage.  I love the samurai genre and have seen probably every example (when the last sword is drawn is best in my view) and therefore felt compelled to watch this movie despite the fact I cant stand Cruise but in truth I have to say I LOVED THIS MOVIE.  It is superbly well made, visually stunning and very moving. Koyuki and uijo were deeply impressive as was katsumoto.  I have seen it six times now and it just gets better.  The soundtrack is worth buying on it\'s own. It deserved to have been  better received when it was released but it was in competition with \'the return of the king\' which was unfortunate as the last samurai is far the better film.  No one I know who has seen this film has anything less than great admiration for it.'),(1344,9,'B0001G6PZC','Dallas Buyers Club','The Last Samurai leaves a Lasting impression','Awesome movie. Many people say that it is long and boring, but it is only half true. The movie is long, its 154 minutes, but it is by no means boring. This movie has a solid story line which it follows throughout the whole movie. It is centered around one character (Tom Cruise), and he appears in just about every scenes. However, the other characters aren\'t left out of the movie either. They all play parts that are just as important. This movie is also quite informative; before seeing it I knew little about the samurai, but I learned quite a bit about these Japanese warriors from this movie. Also there are some great fighting scenes in this movie that are worth watching. Overall, I think this was a great movie and I recommend for people to see it.<br /><br />4.5 stars but Amazon doesn\'t have halves. :('),(1345,9,'B0001G6PZC','Dallas Buyers Club','Many good points, and a few very bad','The Last Samurai does many things exactly right, but falls short in a few key respects. It\'s a great action movie, and passable as a drama. That\'s a shame, because it could have been great on both counts.<br /><br />The major problem with this movie is that the main character is played by Tom Cruise. This isn\'t because I think he\'s a bad actor; in fact, I think he does a pretty good job with his role in this film. However, a white man was totally unnecessary here -- this movie would have been much better off as a story dealing only with the Japanese. The assimilation that occurs here strains credulity, and certainly Ken Watanabe, in a sterling performance as Katsumoto, could have carried a film himself. The fact that the presence of Cruise is a necessary concession to the target audience makes it forgivable, but not likable.<br /><br />Things would have been better if Cruise\'s character, Algren, were better explored by the film. Unfortunately, although Cruise does his best, the writers don\'t seem to know what to do with Algren. Though his transformation is the heart of this story, we never really come to understand who Algren was at the beginning, and have only a vague idea of who he has become at the end. Even his journal entries, poorly narrated by Cruise, grant us little insight. We are merely left to take for granted that Algren would come to respect, rather than resent, his captors. Why Algren takes a more enlightened approach to other cultures than his American peers is also a mystery.<br /><br />This lack of insight into Algren should be contrasted with Katsumoto, whose motivations, though convoluted by modern standards, are fully explicated.<br /><br />In other respects, this film succeeds greatly, and masterfully avoids falling into most of the Hollywood traps. There\'s no sex scene, no pointless explosions, and in many ways, no happy ending. The battle scenes are wonderfully shot, and the setting is excellently delineated. The emotional interplay between Cruise and his Japanese counterparts is good in most instances, though there are a few moments that falter. And Katsumoto\'s final scene is powerful and moving, an excellent note on which to end a movie.<br /><br />Unfortunately, they didn\'t go straight from there to the film\'s epilogue. Instead, they tacked on an additional scene with Algren and the emperor, in which the dialogue consisted almost entirely of cliches, and the young Emperor (jarringly) speaks in idiomatic American English. It\'s crap, and it comes at the end of the movie, where it does the most damage.<br /><br />If you can convince yourself to forget that awful piece of filmmaking, however, The Last Samurai has some resonance, a moving story, and compelling characters. Katsumoto in particular is one of the most interesting characters to come onscreen in recent years, and I cannot stress enough how well Ken Watanabe plays him. This movie is worth renting just to see his intense performance. If you\'re a fan of samurai films in general, it\'s probably worth a buy. It\'s far from the quality of a Kurosawa epic, but The Last Samurai is a much better film than your average Hollywood blockbuster.'),(1346,9,'B0001G6PZC','Dallas Buyers Club','great action movie','This movie is one of the greatest action movies I have ever seen, with great acting, directing, and a great plot.  It keeps you interested for the full 2 and a half hours.  Nathan (Tom Cruise) is recruited (by his superior officer whom he despises) to train the Japanese army (he was a good warrior in the battles in the U.S. against the \"Indians\") as the Japanese are trying to civilize themselves and be a world power and they want to get rid of the Samurai and rural way of life and customs (including no firearms).  After being ordered to lead the Japanese Army into battle prematurely against the Samurai he is almost killed and captured by the Samurai as the Army gets demolished even with their guns.  He lives with the Samurai and their leaded Katsumoto, who after a while the two take a great liking to one another and Nathan begins to train with them and learn their lifestyle and discipline which he comes to highly admire.  After being returned almost 2 years later to the Japanese Army (which is 20 times larger now) he finds they have new firepower (gattling guns and cannons) and they will destroy the Samurai\'s in battle.  Katsumoto then turns himself in to the Emporer (who is his friend) only to be told he will die. But Nathan and the other Samurai\'s rescue Katsumoto and Nathan takes up w/ them in a battle against the whole Japanese Army.  That\'s all I\'ll tell you but you have to go see the movie, it\'s GREAT and you\'ll be pleased, especially at the ending and the honor and discipline that is promoted through the movie.'),(1347,9,'B0001G6PZC','Dallas Buyers Club','Very entertaining and has oscar written all over it','I had the privilage of the movie and all i can say that it was amazing. everything from the acting to the set designs was great.

Tom does an excellent job and proves his acting can garner an oscar nomination for a lead role.'),(1348,10,'B0001G6PZC','Dallas Buyers Club','enjoyable and powerful film','a very enjoyable film with captivating visuals (the filmmakers deserve much credit for filming in actual authentic locations) and powerful, realistic fight scenes.<br /><br />The story does test one\'s \"believability standards\" a bit, but in a manner akin to Gladiator and so many others. This is Hollywood. Sit back and give yourself to the movie. There is so much here to enjoy.'),(1349,10,'B0001G6PZC','Dallas Buyers Club','Definately a SHOGUN rip-off','I haven\'t read all of the reviews, so I don\'t know if this has been touched, but this is a total rip-off of the novel Shogun by Clavell. It just happens in a more &quot;modern&quot; Japan. Clavell\'s is in the year 1600, this one is more like 1860 or so.<br /><br /> The movie is long, overly long. I\'m pretty tired in the evenings and this took about 3 days to watch!<br /><br /> The acting is good & the battles and sword fights are great. However, this movie really has nothing to offer as far as originality, tone, or filming. I\'m really surprised it was even made.'),(1350,10,'B0001G6PZC','Dallas Buyers Club','Don\'t expect too much','What\'s the reason for watching The Last Samurai? The sword-fighting scenes.  There are a lot of sword-fighting scenes, they\'re well-done, and if you enjoy watching them you\'ll find entertainment value in the movie.  Also, the Japanese countryside is filmed beautifully here, so if you have an appreciation for nature, it\'s another incentive to watch.<p>Otherwise, The Last Samurai is nothing special.  The storyline is simplistic; the samurai are all two-dimensional and unquestionably the fine and good people in the film.  They can do no evil, truly.  For Cruise it\'s one of those self-righteous roles where he gets to look angsty for the camera.  There\'s one scene at the end for example, where he\'s kneeling and holding up a sword, and he\'s trying to look like someone who is under great emotional strain and there are these ludicrous close-ups of his sweaty face - really gratuitous.  The movie defintely would have benefited from some editing and character development.'),(1355,10,'B0001G6PZC','Dallas Buyers Club','Honor Vs. The Gatling Gun','I did not hear the best reviews of The Last Samurai when it came out. Many said it was a good film, but not up to the epic status it had obviously tried to achieve. My mother is not at all a Tom Cruise fan, so I did not hear much good about him either.<br />  Then my grandparents glowingly recommended the movie to my whole family, and we decided to watch it with them one night when they came over. What I had seen when it ended was a moving, excellent film which, if not perhaps an epic, is certainly a wonderful tale of a culture and heritage slipping away from an ancient and lasting civiliazation.<br />  As I said, this movie is perhaps not an epic on the scale of-The Lord of the Rings, for example. It does not contain quite the sweep and grand scale that the latter has in buckets. It is about honor, about discipline, and about a man from a completely different country who joins forces with the samurai. So no, I would not necessarily call it an epic, although it certainly contains some of the ingredients of one. Whether the director and screenwriters intended it to be, I do not know, but that certainly does not keep it from being one of the better films I have seen.<br />  The hero is Captain Nathan Algren, a Civil War veteran and soldier in the 7th Cavalry who fought in the Indian wars. At the beginning of the film, however, he is not employed in warfare, but in promoting the weapons of the Winchester arms company. He does not come out to perform in time, however, and he is fired.<br />  Another job comes his way, however, when his commander asks him to accept the offer of a certain Mr. Omura, a man highly ranked in the Japanese government who, in accordance with his and the Japanese emperor\'s wishes to westernize his nation, is employing American soldiers to train the Japanese army. Algren agrees, although horrible memories of attacking innocent settlements in the Indian wars make him loathe his commander.<br />  Once in Japan, Algren assumes the responsibility of training the Japanese army, which consists mostly of peasants who have never even held guns.<br />  Then, before the army is fully trained, a samurai leader, Katsumoto, a man who thinks Japan is changing too quickly, continues the rebellion he had previously begun by attacking the railroad owned by the same Mr. Omura who hired Algren. Algren\'s superiors insist on attacking, despite Algren maintaining that the troops are unready for combat.<br />  Despite superior firepower and numbers, the Samurai win a resounding victory at the battle, and Algren is captured. But after several difficult months, he finds himself living among friends, not enemies. He is captivated by the ideals and disciplines of the samurai, and comes to fight on their side in a climactic battle whose outcome will decide Japan\'s future.<br />  The directing is certainly very good-Edward Zwick seems to be one of those talented fellows who can have two characters very obviously love each other without commiting fornication. That was one of the most amazing aspects of this movie. The sister of Katsumoto comes to love Algren during the course of his stay, and they actually remain chaste. Wow! What a concept! I am sick of having well-made movies filled with trash that renders it off-limits, and The Last Samurai was refreshingly free of sex.<br />  A word of warning, though-it is fairly violent, and there is some swearing, so despite it\'s good qualities I wouldn\'t recommend it for the younger children.<br />  The camera-work is also excellent, giving us some views of the wonderful countryside of...New Zealand. I find it a little strange that this movie was not actually filmed in Japan, but the country is so beautiful I can overlook it, and it looked to me like a place that could easily be found in Japan. But I have never been there, so don\'t take my word for it.<br />  The acting is good, and having no previous exposure to Tom Cruise I was able to be satisfied with his performance and not have any unpleasant memories from his past films. Ken Watanabe is very good as Katsumoto, and Hiroyuki Koyuki is wonderful as Katsumoto\'s sister.<br />  But perhaps the best of all are the values in Last Samurai. Honor, devotion to duty, discipline, and courage to do what you believe is right in the face of danger are all lauded here. I don\'t think Western culture is being universally blasted here, but I do think the film makers are trying to say that technology is not all that matters; but that values and morals should be honored and practiced. Hollywood does not recognize that Jesus Christ is the only answer to life\'s questions and that He is the reason that all these morals are held in such high esteem, but they are at least doing something better than their ordinary fare.<br />  Definitely recommended!'),(1356,10,'B0001G6PZC','Dallas Buyers Club','cruise shoulda gotta oscar','This is the best damn tom cruise ever.I forgot that was tom and believed he was capt.nathan algren.this movie is a masterpiece.forget that review above and watch this instant classic.'),(1357,10,'B0001G6PZC','Dallas Buyers Club','Movie: decent, Tom Cruise: meh','This movie shuffled along the line between action movie and epic story, and it kept a somewhat uneasy balance between those two styles.  It was beautifully, if obviously, shot, capturing both majestic landscapes and gorgeous detail, and the acting, for the most part, was very good.  Ken Watanabe deserves all the praise he has received for the role, and Koyuki performed very subtly and ably as the quasi-love interest. It also contained the requisite battle scenes, which I found to be effective in communicating the brutality and violence without being overly graphic and disgusting.  The scenes with the young emperor were perhaps the most moving of the entire film, and there was enough attention paid to the individual lives contained in the story without forgetting the big picture, so to speak.  <p>It should have been a better movie... and I\'m afraid that my disappointment in it lies mostly with the lead actor.  I don\'t like Tom Cruise... I don\'t find him attractive, and I don\'t think he\'s a good actor, and that definitely colored the movie for me.  The fact that Tom Cruise was supposed to be the person that carried the movie... well... I guess you can\'t argue with the box office.  Regardless, a lot of the lines he spoke or the story he represented seemed rather clich&eacute;d, overdone, or plain anachronistic with the world around him.  <p>As for the moral of the movie... that heritage and national identity should not be forgotten (and should especially not be exterminated) on the way to modernity... It managed to ring hollow while coming across too heavy handed.  However, considering the genre, it was a somewhat complex moral, as far as morals go.  It wasn\'t a bad movie, but I wasn\'t swept away either.  I give it about a 5 out of 10.'),(1358,10,'B0001G6PZC','Dallas Buyers Club','Good.

That\'s cool. In general, the movie is very manipulative emotionally and tangles you up immediately in the plot and especially the character played Tom Cruise. Another big point is that the cinematography and the just plain beauty of the mountains is captured with extraordinary talent and adds much to the ability of the movie to involve us. So go read the other reviews for this kind of information.<p>I\'m interested in the mythos, the usage of stories to build structures of ideas, to support and extent values, in general the use of movies like this to teach moral legends. It is the storytellers art, the Homeric epics that once were passed down around campfires by old men to their grandchildren. Whispers in the dark about the giants of reknown, the heroes of the golden ages, the fighters like the battle of Thermopylae (a tale told in the movie) whose courage saved a nation. But what makes this not history but holy history, not even historical fiction but just mythos is the gap between the truth of what really was history and the storytellers art. In our age, we simply won\'t even believe it plausible if it doesn\'t proport to be history, it must be clothed in the rags of historical illusion, no matter about the bones of truth or flesh of reality. All that matters is that the clothing is authentic, the characters are believable to the masses of us who didn\'t get much out of 8th grade world history, let alone a college history of Japan class. Mythos must appear as logos (thanks to Karen Armstrong for the images), but appearances are all that truely matters. The storytellers art takes over immediately and operates from the beginning to weave a tale, to build a moralizing story that thrills us and challenges us to absorb the morality and those values presented in the movie.<p>The major value is honor, the battle of the underdog against overwhelming odds, the fight of old tradition and new technology. The samurai are presented as warrior Buddhist monks, ascetic and pure of heart, challenging their faults and getting better every day due to this passion for excellence and practice, practice, practice. And Tom Cruise\'s character is a samurai born out of place, a real warrior\'s heart, dismayed and beaten down by the brutal Army murders of native American women and children. Full of nightmares and sweats out the DT\'s, and falls in love with his real people, the mountain volk, where he learns Japanese in a winter, plus has a satori experience with sword fighting, all the time keeping a journal complete with sketches.<p>Well, maybe i am a little cynical, skeptical at being manipulating in such a blatant way, cautious at the prospect at going to a movie for entertainment and getting a moralizing message in such a direction and almost hamfisted way. I ask what is the object of the samurai\'s honor? Towards the emperor? only outwardly. Towards traditional family values? not with all the bloodshed and teaching boys to kill young. Towards life? not with the suicide impulse just below the surface. It appears to be honor for honor\'s sake, value without a fundamental object, without a big point, but honor simply as a survival value on the battlefield. To have honor motivates, inspires, swings the sword harder and longer, kills without compassion, it the basic utilitarian value of the warrior class. That is what the movie is about, the flowers and poetry, the buddhist chanting and zen archery are pieces tacked on to balance out the blood and glore of the battlescenes. For these humane values are not the ones which motivate the characters, but rather the glory of battle, not the fighting-for-the-guy-next-to-you that is so common in war movies, but the glory for oneself. The bloody sword at the end of the day dripping with the red life of your enemies. And it really doesn\'t matter who your enemies are: the American south, the cheyenne, the sioux, or the japos, or your ex-commanding officer, or..... It doesn\'t matter for all is but a stage to demonstrate and display your prowess as a hero, your stamina as a fighter, your perseverance as an honorable man. this is what i object to, value without purpose, utility without direction, heroes without Gods.<p>It is a gorgous movie, enough battlescenes for the most jaded martial arts afficiado, a little added metaphysics for those of us who like such things in our movies, but most of all a not-at-all subtile honor is valuable for its own sake take home message. I\'d just be cautious of swallowing the point without thinking about the greater issues.'),(1371,19,'B0001G6PZC','Dallas Buyers Club','DANCES WITH WOLVES Part 2!','This movie is NOT the sequel to Dances with Wolves!

One reviewer complains that the Japanese actors were just being Japanese, and therefore not acting. After so many slice and dice \'em samurai movies, this one is a slice way above the rest.  Ken Watanabe starts the movie in deep meditation and having a vision.  His strong centeredness from meditation is carried through the entire film.  He did not get shaken by even the most insulting behavior from Cruise as Captain Algren.  This chemistry was special throughout the film.  This is a formula that includes real story telling, action, a demand to stretch your understanding, and more action.  Therefore, the reviews cite the action as good and the rest as bad.  I respect Tom Cruise a lot more now after seeing this movie, and knowing it became a personal project.  It does remind me of Kevin Costner and \"Dances with Wolves.\"  I am sorry to see a less culturally open minded audience in 2004, outside of the Japanese American communities.'),(1375,25,'B0001G6PZC','Dallas Buyers Club','A Spiritual Journey from the West to the East','As some people would rightly put this great, beautiful film as \"Dances with Wolves\" of the East, the two people here who are being (or almost being) conquered by the Americans, as a representative of the Western \"civilisation\", have a lot in common.<br />Not only the upheaval and tragic situations they had in those period, but I have found those two people\'s spiritual beliefs very similar to each other.<br />Maybe that is because they both are kind of animists who believe that every things on Earth has spirit----trees, mountains, rivers, seas, rocks, etc.... Not to mention human beings and other creatures. The humans are only a part of the nature. So, like a weed grows and dies, we all are born and die. Simple. <p>Like the American Indians say; \"It is a good day to die today.\", famous book of Bushido, the Samurai code, \"Hagakure\" says; \"The ultimate Bushido is found in the way you die.\"<br />Here, as well as profoundly understanding the meanings of life and death, accepting one\'s own life as it is is a crucial point to get through. Because you have your own purpose of life as you are born to the circumstances you were given.<br />And it applies to everybody, not only to the Samurais.<br />For what were you born? For what are you going to die?<br />If you know the answer, you are ready to die in the honourable and graceful way it should be.<br />It is not that only the deaths of Samurais in action or by Harakiri taking responsibility are honourable/graceful. Everyone who has completed his/her duty of his/her life can die in honour and grace.<p>It doesn\'t mean that Samurais were crazy, trigger-happy suicidal/homicidal maniacs, though. I have to make sure here that nobody misunderstands what I am saying because sometimes some people seem to think that the Kamikaze attacks in the world war 2 were the acts of that kind of insanity. I can tell you how wrong their thoughts are. If you see this film and take it correctly, you should understand that as well.<br /><br />It is a matter of readiness. Your readiness to die makes your life meaningful. Meaningful life makes your soul shine.<br />That is every human being\'s purpose to be born to this world.<br />Concuerors can destroy your home and kill you, but no one can break your spirit if you are ready to die.<br />What Algren underwent in his battle fields in both America and Japan against and with those \"savages\" made him know that. <p>After a hundred years\' struggle against the powers of the Western civilisation, Japan seemed to have narrowly escaped from being colonised and subhumanised only because Japan had a large population that were ready to die for the survival of their country and their people putting themselves together tightly under the name of the Emperor. But, did she, really?<br />\"The Last Samurai\" made me think about where I came from and who I am. Maybe I and other modern day Japanese, who became conveniently Westernised and forgot about our spiritual roots should just stop and rethink of the meaning of life.'),(1376,20,'B0001G6PZC','Dallas Buyers Club','Cruise on the Epic Level','First you must understand I am a huge Tom Cruise fan therefore my review may come off bias, but this is truly a great movie believe me or not!

This film has it all great cast, passionate and exciting storyline, and beautiful cinematography to top it off. I recommend this film to anyone and everyone, enjoy!!!'),(1377,21,'B0001G6PZC','Dallas Buyers Club','Pretty silly','Tom Cruise as a Samurai warrior?--my curiosity got the better of me! Be prepared to suspend all disbelief for<br /><br />2 1/2 hours for this film. Drunken, guilt-ridden, Indian War veteran is hired by Japanese government to stamp out  rebellion, gets captured, dries out, and over the course of a few months becomes a disciplined, fierce, Zen-like Samurai warrior. In his spare time he becomes fluent in Japanese. He switches sides, becomes a master tactician, kills countless Japanese soldiers and a few Americans along the way, and lives to tell the tale.<br /><br />The scenery was nice, the Japanese actors terrific, and thankfully the incipient love affair wasn\'t allowed to blossom on screen, which would have violated every norm of Japanese culture of the time. Maybe I\'m taking it too seriously, but the notion that a Westerner could enter this proud, ancient culture with such relative ease seemed almost disrespectful to me. Several reviewers had trouble \"getting\" the idea of honor portrayed in the movie--that\'s just a measure of how totally impossible the plot is. No Westerner could ever do what Cruise does in this movie. Strictly for fun--don\'t expect anything remotely realistic.'),(1378,22,'B0001G6PZC','Dallas Buyers Club','One dimensional','I\'m a big fan a Japanese period movies.  In all those films, whether they are \"high\" art like Kurosawa\'s \"The Seven Samurai\" and \"Ran\", or \"low\" art like \"Lone Wolf and Cub\" or \"Zatoichi\", one of the prevailing themes is the inherent hypocrisy and injustice embedded in the feudal society of old Japan.  How the characters manage to get by in this oppressive society is almost always a source, if not the primary source, of the drama in the story line.  Japanese filmakers know this.  They know that ancient Japan, while admirable in many respects, was not a eutopia by any stretch of the imagination.  Women were property.  Peasants were considered sub-human.  If you were born into a certain class you remained in that class until you died.<br /><br />In \"The Last Samurai\", all these realities are ignored, if not downplayed.  Here the Samurai are portrayed as nothing but completely noble and honorable, innocent victims who merely want to preserve their perfect society.  The Japanese who want to bring Japan into the modern world are all portrayed as corrupt and self-serving, who have no respect for their own cultural heritage.<br /><br />This is the typical hollywood movie; dumbed down for consumption by an audience that that the filmakers assume is too dumb to understand nuance.<br /><br />If you want to learn something about Japan and be entertained at the same time, I would recommend the \"Shogun\" mini-series, which gives a much more balanced view, or check out some of the films I mentioned in the first paragraph.'),(1379,23,'B0001G6PZC','Dallas Buyers Club','Cruising Japan','Tom Cruise appears in yet another film where he rises to the occassion at just the right time, as he has done in many of his previous films, dating back to Top Gun.  It a repetitive, tiresome theme that would have me looking for another role if I were him.  Don\'t get me wrong; I like some of his work (Far and Away is one of his best works to date).<br /><br />As for this film, the cinematography and supporting actor roles are it\'s primary attraction.  It\'s apparent a lot of research was done to pull off this period piece.  The settings and costumes are beautiful.  Watanabe plays superbly as the Samurai warrior Katsumoto.  He is the real star of this movie.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the plot is entirely predictable.  Cruise is an alcoholic fromer Union Captain named Nathan Algren.  He is sent to Japan to train the new Japanese Imperial Army to fight off the diminishing Samurai warriors.  He leads his Army into battle against the Samurai and is soundly beaten.  Katsumoto spares Algren\'s life and brings him back to health (queue the music).  Algren learns the way of the Samurai warrior and earns the respect of his Samurai brethren.  Eventually he has to face the very Japanese Army he helped train, this time fighting on the side of the Samurai.<br /><br />This is where it goes from unlikely to absurd.  Cruise and hundreds of remaining Samurai face off with the Imperial Army in a showdown copied several times over since Mel Gibson\'s Braveheart.  Samurai drop like flies as they charge the inexperienced but better equipped Imperial Army soldiers.  As it turns out (no surprise here), Watanabe and Cruise are the last survivors of the battle.  Though severely wounded by gunfire,  Katsumoto squeezes his abdomen tightly to allow a few more pints of blood to nourish his brain while he performs his farewell speech to Cruise.  He dies and leaves Cruise as.....you guessed it!  The Last Samurai.  I heard that Japanese movie audiences were passing out at the very sight.<br /><br />On a side note, it\'s rumored that Nathan Algren returned to America and travelled together with Kung Fu through the desert southwest, metting out some pain to those who crossed them.  Unfortunately, Algren returned to the bottle, and in a drunken rage one friday nite, eviscerated Kung Fu at a bar in Tucumcari.  Ironically, Algren died shortly thereafter while drinking numerous Grasshoppers.  He lies in an unmarked grave just outside of Ft. Sumner, New Mexico.'),(1380,24,'B0001G6PZC','Dallas Buyers Club','I know the Japanese are accomodating, but this is ridiculous!','If you took Tom Cruise and Ken Watanabe out of this storyline, it\'s really nothing but a Steven Seagal/ Chuck Norris movie.  (The Last Samurai is also a reiteration of Harrison Ford\'s Witness, minus the charm.)  Invincible American white man goes to Asian country, learns their tradition to perfection in a mere two seasons, and becomes one of their leaders to lead them into war, and survives the battlefield while every Japanese samurai gets annihilated, ending in a scene where EVERY Japanese soldier kneels and bows to the great white god on the battlefield.  When you tell a story where the protagonist has ALL the good cards all the time, it makes you question whether the movie has a message, or is just another advancing notch in  cultural imperialism, creating a storyline where natural selection enables the superior party to continue into the next  generation.  I know entertainment should be treated as entertainment and not historical fact or social theory, but when you have highly questionable circumstances, then it throws the other, more important aspects of the movie into question.<br /><br />Now I understand that this movie is literally a rice queen\'s dream come true.  I mean, there are very few places in this world where you can kill a man, say \"I\'m sorry\" to the hot widow, and end up hopping in the sack with her.  All this while the dead man\'s surviving children adore and dote over you, the man who killed their father.  Once we question the realism of a man being able to master a form of martial arts in a few months, we begin to question the success rate of whether we, can indeed go around killing men if we want to sleep with their wives.  And if we can\'t buy into THAT fantasy, well then what the heck is the point of watching the movie!?<br /><br />The photography was good and the acting wasn\'t bad.  At one point I wished dearly that the sentimental soundtrack would halt.  War is a horrific act of mankind.  I think this movie went to lengths to capture the reality and horror of war combined with man against machine, and it came stunningly close.  In independent foreign films, war scenes have often been depicted without any lush orchestration.  I think that, is a responsible decision.  I could not help envisioning the battlefield climax without the soundtrack.  Just the hard reality of men\'s groans, horses neighing, and screams of terror in the stark afternoon air would deliver the message tenfold.  I felt insulted that music needed to be enlisted to \"help\" me feel that way about something so horrific.<br /><br />Koyuki plays Taka, the widow, who is curiously mute throughout the movie.  It\'s the stereotypical form of submissiveness that the West is comfortable with when it comes to Asian women.  Cruise\'s lack of facial expressiveness is hidden by facial hair, so that helped.<br /><br />All in all, I thought it had great potential.  I gave it an extra star because it came close to capturing how horrific war is, especially when one side is over-armed, and the other has, only honor.'),(1381,17,'B0001G6PZC','Dallas Buyers Club','Extra care taken--Bubble Wrap!!','Great transaction, product in excellent condition as promoted, prompt shipping and extra care taken with bubble wrap inside a padded envelope!

The insights into Japan during this particular time setting---the late 1800s, when the samurai way of life was slowly fading away and Westernization was taking over---are sure to fascinate, and the action scenes are first-rate, as is the widescreen cinematography here by John Toll. <p>Ken Watanabe got justly deserved plaudits for his authoritative supporting turn here as samurai leader Katsumoto---he really takes the screen by force. A lot of critics, for some reason, weren\'t so complementary to Tom Cruise, as the American Nathan Algren, here. Perhaps they thought his pretty-boy image got in the way of either the epic\'s grand ambition or the effectiveness of his own performance. Whatever the reason, I personally didn\'t have such problems with Cruise in this movie---he seemed convincing enough here, although he certainly is upstaged by the sheer authority of Watanabe\'s performance.<p>In short, THE LAST SAMURAI is overall a grand and glorious epic that admirably attempts to be more than just pretty pictures and awesome action scenes, and, more often than not, it succeeds in its noble ambitions. If the ending does come off as too preachy or over-sentimental in the usual Hollywood manner---well, I find it a forgivable lapse, indicative of the filmmakers\' desire to function as both thoughtful historical commentary and great entertainment at the same time. I don\'t think many people will be bored by this movie (like many many people seem to be with LOST IN TRANSLATION).

The situation, the final wresting of power from the last of the feudal lords, is historically true. The movie\'s story, however, involving the American gone native, is synthetic.<p>It\'s a good movie. It addresses the Japanese culture with knowledge and respect. It brings to life one of the defining moments of Japanese history, possibly the one moment that marks the start of modern era. The costuming and architecture are beautiful. It presents the bushido, the samurai ethic, as an all-consuming force in the lives of the samurai themselves but also in their families.<p>Still, I have reservations about semi-historical movies. Takamori\'s final battle is an historical event, and this presentation of it is fiction. Lord knows that Americans need more exposure to world history and that this flick is an enticing way to present it. Still, the movie blurs the line between fact and fiction, between entertainment and events as documented. As much as I like the movie, I don\'t think that it serves history very well.'),(1391,26,'B0001G6PZC','Dallas Buyers Club','Expected to hate it -- loved it!','A lot of reviewers wax philosophical as they describe their reasons for disliking the movie -- not historically accurate, an offense to the Japanese, an offense to Western culture.

I was very excited to hear this movie was coming out. I not only admire Edward Zwick\'s other movies but I am a Tom Cruise fan as well. Unfortunately I was very disappointed in the movie, Tom Cruise was fantastic and the cinematography is beautiful but the film is almost completely \"factless\". America did open up trade with Japan but French and German officers trained the Japanese imperial army, They at the time had the best Foot soldiers. Also the young Emperor of Japan was not torn between the new and old ways, He instead was the driving force behind modernizing Japan as fast as it did, he saw the Samurai as one of the main reasons Japan had fallen so far behind. The Samurai that rebelled against the Emperor were considered \"RONIN\" meaning Samurai with no master, and sense Samurai means \"To serve\" they were despised by the Samurai that served the Emperor and were perceived as Dishonorable. The rebel Samurai also had full divisions that used Firearms, it was not the Bows vs. Rifles you see in the movie. And most importantly it was not the Honorable Samurai protecting the Peasant people from the heartless new way of the Evil imperial Japanese Government, quit the opposite is true. Japan had been divided for more then a century, the clans had known nothing but war. When the Shogun took power the Emperor was nothing more then a symbol and was never allowed to leave his Palace. The Shogun had the real power and the whole time it was most of Japan, the peasants and working class that suffered under the Samurai, They were Honorable warriors but only to other Samurai, ordinary Japanese were considered Less then Men and could be killed at the whims of the Samurai. It was the modernization of Japan that threatened the rule of the Samurai with the Shogun being forced to step down in 1867 and put the power back in the hands of the Emperor as well as the working class of Japan. Most Samurai saw this and surrendered the old way to the new seeing that The Samurai were obsolete, but the few that rebelled were motivated by Power, status and wealth that they were losing and not for the People of Japan like the film so badly suggests. This is a fun film if you watch it as a fantasy adventure with no basis in history. I give it a low rating because even thought both Tom Cruise and Edward Zwick admit that this is not what really happened but wanted to capture the spirit of the Samurai in a fiction film, I feel this is irresponsible and that this film dishonors The real history of Japan. I would like to add that the Chinese feel Honoring the Samurai and Japanese values is like Honoring Nazis and their way of life and I don\'t blame them for feeling that way considering there History.'),(1395,28,'B0001G6PZC','Dallas Buyers Club','Where are the American Samurais?','Reading this may ruin your viewing of the movie, Last Samurai, by forwarning you of what it is about. <p>The latest Tom Cruise movie, The Last Samurai is a terrific movie-- portraying the role of big business in pushing for and aiding in the elimination of a native culture that was not supportive of trade and commerce, in this case, in Japan. And of course the US was there to provide and sell weapons and military training to kill the simple, less technological natives.<br />Cruise plays a tortured yet heroic character, asurvivor of the Civil War and Indian wars who stands up to the commercial, US and japanese forces who are attempting to wipe out the last of the Samurais. He stands up to these powers because it is the right thing, the noble thing to do. <p>Why don\'t we see American warriors standing up. It is almost impossible for men and women GIs in Iraq to speak out. But where are the veterans who can see that the Iraq quagmire has been a bumbling fraud, built on lies and stupid unpreparedness. Where are the brave men and women who fought in Iraq in 1991 to free Kuwait, who should clearly see what a horrific travesty the Bush administration machinations have been. <p>The movie was one of the best of the year, with Oscar caliber acting, script, set, and costumes, in a season with a plethora of disappointing films. I left with a glow in my heart and feeling both inspired and disgusted-- inspired by the heroic actions Tom Cruise portrays, disgusted by the way the US government has had a history of helping in the wiping out of indigenous noble cultures.

There, however, the originality ends.<br /><br />The Last Samurai borrows very heavily from A Man Called Horse (with a hefty dash of Dances With Wolves, Soldier Blue and Braveheart).<br /><br />Tom Cruise gives us a pretty damn good depiction of the tortured, alcoholic civil war veteran Nathan Algren, exorcising the demons of wartime atrocities by going to Japan to ply his trade, but, once the initial battle is complete and he is taken prisoner by Katsumoto\'s (Watanabe) luddite army, the constraints of a very limited and predictable storyline become apparent.<br /><br />It is no surprise that Cruise falls for the widow who tends him, nor that he (in remarbly short time) learns to speak Japanese and fight in the manner of the Samurai.<br /><br />The battle sequences are undeniably spectacular, and the sets, costumes and audio are always first rate. I very much enjoyed Timothy Spall\'s support role, and Watanabe was convincingly stoic. No surprises though. No sense of wonder.

There is a nice touch in the love triangle between our hero and the wife of his fallen enemy -- and that enemy who \"haunts\" him -- but that he comes to honor. What an interesting feature that adds marvelously to this template. What is the moral narrative of this story? Industry bad, nature good? Those who follow ancient practices good, modern science bad?

Sailing into Yokohama harbor looks ridiculous.  A street scene at night in Tokyo (where Tom Cruise is surrounded by swordsmen) looked entirely like it had been filmed afterhours at Universal Studios in Orlando.

My view veers toward the former as all I was left with after having see the film is this feeling: Haven\'t I seen this before? In a word, what\'s the difference between Dance With Wolves and this one? Seen as a historical epic, this is positively bad. How those fully armoured warriors could exist in the mid nineteenth century Japan is anyone\'s guess, not to mention the Ninjya. Isn\'t this familiar? There was something of a vogue for things Japanese in the 80s when Miyamoto Musashi\'s Book of Five Rings was a big hit. Well, there were a bunch of Japan bashers too, given the economic imbalance that existed between the two countries back then. Things probably look a bit different now as Japan is positively seen as a U.S. ally or a partner in crime, depending on how you look at it, as the U.S. vows to dust all \"bad\" regimes off the face of the planet.

It even had a hint of the UK in it, but doesn\'t excel in any of these countries filmmaking areas whatsoever.<br /><br />So with a tad more action and some a better final scene, and an overhaul done to the story to showcase at least one other person besides tommy boy.<br /><br />It does have a couple of good action scenes and the production value is very high, just don\'t expect to see a real samurai movie.'),(1404,32,'B0001G6PZC','Dallas Buyers Club','Keeps your attention, but don\'t buy for your collection','This movie can hold your attention, but historically it is somewhat inaccurate.

So, hearing that he was going to be in a movie like this, I groaned and thought, \"Damn.  I wish he\'d done this movie five years ago.  He\'ll probably ruin it now.\"  But hey, I\'m a total Japanese culture lover, so I figured I\'d watch it anyway.<br /><br />I thought I was disappointed with the movie when it began, because they set up the plot very slowly, and lay out a large amount of information that seems irrelevant.  But, like the quiet slice of sword through air, the pieces began to come together, and I found myself enraptured with the film.<br /><br />Ken Watanabe (Katsumoto)\'s presence on the screen is breathtaking, as were his family and friends.  Taka, the heroine, was beautiful in her silence, and the scene with her and Tom at the end was...well, unforgettable.  Omura is excellent and, like the rest of those mentioned here, enfuses so much emotion in one gesture or expression.  Nobutada (the archer) was, I believe, my favorite character outside of Watanabe.  His final scene had me sobbing.  But I think most impressive is the way that Tom Cruise doesn\'t dominate this film.  It\'s almost as if he, like his character, is enraptured and humbled by these people, and he\'s purposefully pulling himself in, so that THEY shine on screen.<br /><br />Overall, an absolutely spectacular film.  It\'s perhaps a bit too intelligent for some, a bit too poignant for others.  It is, however, a film that I hope will inspire others.  Its lessons are vast.<br /><br />I only wish there were a prequel, so that I could see Katsumoto, Taka, Nobutada, and Omura more, and in all their glory.'),(1408,12,'B0001G6PZC','Dallas Buyers Club','Good action movie, but not family friendly.','The Last Samurai is a movie of great action that ends in sadness.

For a better sword action movie with sharp editing and a great screen play, check out Antonio Banderas in the Thirteenth Warrior.  13th is still not a movie for your 10 year old, but that is more because it creates a scariness and feeling of dread about what the Warriors are up against.'),(1409,12,'B0001G6PZC','Dallas Buyers Club','Wonderful and Spectacular','Besides the emense amounts of gore *do to violent war scenes* it has beautiful scenery and wonderful messages of love.

Its quite fascinating how this story, even though the character Algren and the dealings with the Americans were fiction how this story was so well drawn out. The character that portrayed the legendary Saigo, or \"Dai Saigo\" otherwise known as a fictional character as Katsumoto did such a dramatically important role, a role in which it took a strong will and personality to play. The honor and prestige that each warrior felt back in history was shown in the faces of the individuals that gave their time and skills into making this film historically memorable.

The Japanese have used guns since they first encountered them from the Europeans in the early 1400\'s, from these they reverse engineered.

An insult to Japanese filmakers like Akira Kurosawa (Seven Samurai) and Hiroshi Inagaki (Samurai Trilogy) who\'s Samurai films have captured the hearts of audeinces worldwide. <p>Not only is this film a rip off of those directors but it\'s also a poor attempt at mimicing Hollywood epics like Braveheart. Probably the worst thing about this film is Tom Cruise\'s occaisional narration of his diary. What kind of warrior keeps a diary anyway? Isn\'t that for pansies? Anyway it serves as pointless drivel that mearly point\'s out the allready obvious. It\'s like they tried to make this film idiot proof. I think they should have focused on making it average joe/jane pissed off cause they spent 5 bucks to rent this crap proof.  <p>The Characater development in this film was pretty much the same any Jean Claued Van Damme film.

Every Japanese history textbook I\'ve ever read says that the conscript soldiers were disdained by the haughty samurai, but that they proved their bravery and worth in the battles against them.  There\'s nothing in this film that shows the arrogance and contempt the samurai had for the &quot;dirt farmers&quot; whom they expected to easily defeat, but who stood their ground and shot them to pieces.  The samurai, incidentally, had just as many cannons and muskets as their opponents.  I cannot understand why the filmmaker had to make the samurai\'s enemies so evil and stupid, instead of portraying the war as a sincere clash of cultures between men who fought for what they belived in.<br />  Morally, it really hurt me to see Tom Cruise (Algren) wading so cold-bloodedly into the teenage troops he had been training six months ago and butchering them without the slightest compunction.  And there wasn\'t even any sort of remorse voiced by Cruise/Algren, even in a cliched, off-the-cuff sort of way (&quot;Many brave men on both sides will die today.&quot;).  Maybe he hacked to death that poor, scared man he was trying to teach how to shoot earlier in the film.<br />  This is one of those films that, like &quot;The Patriot&quot;, gets every cuff button and chin-strap of the costumes right, but fails to capture the spirit of an era and its people by resorting to black-and-white/good-and-evil cliches.  It looks geat, but has a rotten core.'),(1428,26,'B0001G6PZC','Dallas Buyers Club','The Journey of a Lost Soul and the Story a Dying Culture','Just as the ocean has shallow ends and deep ends, The Last Samurai is a film whose story, in part, lies on the surface and also lies, in part, deeper beneath the surface. At face value, you will find a tale about an old world culture (the Samurai culture) clashing with a rising, powerful modern culture (Western culture). Although this is almost certainly an oversimplification of the story, the clash-of-cultures saga played out in this movie is basically the \"shallow end\" of the premise. In fact, the story and setting in and of themselves are merely a convenient backdrop for which to convey its actual message; which is much deeper and more interesting. <p>Cruise plays 7th Cavalry Army Captain, Nathan Algren. He is a troubled and tormented man who is haunted by tremendous guilt, brought on by his experiences fighting and killing American Indians circa 1876. He is generally lauded as a hero around the US, ironically admired for the very actions that precipitate his self-loathing. He is not interested in fame or accolades; he is a man who desperately wants to escape his personal demons, but is completely helpless to suffer through them. Like many people who suffer from such inescapable torment, he turns to the bottle for his salvation. Still present are the post-traumatic nightmares and flashbacks of his war-fighting days. But alas, as he tries to drown his sorrows, they do indeed learn to swim. His acquired inclination toward the excessive consumption of libations notwithstanding, he does his best to cope, however unfruitful his efforts may be. <p>Although he has been begrudgingly following orders to this point, he nevertheless has done his best to fulfill them dutifully. By turn of events, Algren encounters a Japanese General named Hasegawa who has a profitable offer for him. Despite his heavy drinking, Algren is eventually hired to train the Japanese army in Western warfare and to use firearms in battle against the fierce battle-experienced Samurai. Western culture is all the rage in Japan, and powerful political influences want to wipe out the old system that was influenced by the Samurai Code in order to foster a modern Japanese culture. Algren is sent to Japan and finds a group of soldiers who know nothing concerning the use of firearms. He earnestly tries to train them properly so as to prepare them for battle, but Japanese General Hasegawa is impatient with the troops\' development; and much to Algren\'s dismay, Hasegawa orders them to begin fighting Samurai even though the troops are ill-prepared to do so. <p>The first battle against the Samurai is disastrous for the secular Japanese troops, and a slaughter ensues at the hands of the defiant Samurai warriors. But Algren survives the battle and winds up being surrounded by several Samurai. Algren, ever the fearless warrior, stands his ground with a ferocious vigor, showing tremendous valor and honor in displaying that he will fight until his last breath. It is here that Samurai elder and leader, Katsumoto notices Algren\'s impressive will to fight to the death. Katsumoto, if only out of curiosity, spares Algren\'s life and keeps him as a \"free\" captive in his Samurai village until winter passes.<p>During his stay, Algren is treated with dignity albeit an underlying distrust and resentment from the local villagers. Because of his heavy reliance on alcohol, Algren begins going through terrible symptoms of withdrawal from it, as he is weaned from the grips of his addiction. Once his head becomes clear again, he begins to learn from the Samurai villagers\' ways, being influenced by their strong principles and stoic way of life. It is through their cultural mindset that he begins to free his mind from the shackles of the nightmarish suffering that has dogged his troubled mind for so long. Indeed, Captain Algren experiences the personal growth and enlightenment that changes lives and raises one\'s consciousness above darkness and despair.<p>It is during this portion of the story that the \"meat\" of the movie lies. It is here that Algren begins to see life from a different perspective. The Samurai\'s life is a simple one that focuses on virtues espoused by The Samurai Way; values such as honor, integrity, respect, courage, justice, wisdom, etc. The way the villagers were portrayed in the film remind me of a real-life Samurai named Yamamoto Tsunetomo, who once said in a compilation of his writings entitled \"Hagakure\" that one should: \"be true to the thought of the moment and avoid distraction. Other than continuing to exert yourself, enter into nothing else, but go to the extent of living single thought by single thought.\" (Hagakure, p. 69). Much of the village\'s daily life in this movie is summed up quite well by that maxim. <p>In my view, Western culture, though I am fond of it because it is enticingly vivacious, does appear to be soulless and material-based when compared to Eastern Asian cultures. Fast paced, rather emotionally detached, and primarily concerned with wealth, true happiness and peace-of-mind seems to disproportionately elude the advocates of Western values versus supporters of Eastern Asian values. But people and relationships are portrayed as being of high value in Katsumoto\'s village. Artificiality has no home there; their thoughts are focused on the truly important things in life. They spend most of their time on attaining enlightenment and perfecting whatever craft they have chosen to perform in life. The Samurai Way encompasses a broad variety of topics, much of which are elaborated on much further throughout the storytelling in the movie.<p>The Last Samurai is a fantastic movie with a profound message and beautiful cinematography. The acting is top-notch, as Cruise and Ken Watanabe (Katsumoto) pull off a magnificent performance with excellent chemistry. You will be left satisfied and perhaps even moved.

Haters of Western Culture have no fear:  The Last Samarai is here!  In The Last Samurai,  the Westerners (Americans and Brits) are once again the bad guys, infecting yet another innocent race with Western ways.  <p>The silmplistic plot involves American military officers going to Japan to help modernize the imperial military.  The time of the movie is the late 1870\'s when Japan was taking to western culture with a vengeance.  Tom Cruise and his men are hired to train the Japanese military to drive out the last exhisting Samarai warriors who are resistant to the new order. <p>All is going not-so-well, when Tom Cruise ends up captured by the Samarai enemy.  He then falls in love with their culture and their ways.  Cruise then switches sides, eventually leading the Samarai in a final, suicidal assault on the newly equipped Japanese military.  <p>Throughout the flim, the plight of the Samarai is contrasted with that of The Native Americans in  the United States.  Both cultures have been threatened by the destructive effects of modernization (aka the white man\'s ways).  <p>Such parallels are ridiculous.  The idea of  Americans exploiting the \"nobel savage\" is a Western concept\';  such ideas of \"good versus evil\"  have never held sway in Japan.  Moreover,  in real life the last of the Samarai simply resigned, and the prestige of the Samarai order gradually decreased over time.  It was not wiped out by a Westernized military machine.  <p>Therein lies the film\'s irony;  by trying to flatter Japanese culture and history, The Last Samarai insults it.  One example of this is the depiction of Emperor Meji.  He is  depicted as an indecisive, weak- kneed boy who allows himself to be mocked by subordinates.  This is grossly innacurate and just plain shameless.  In reality, anyone who dared challenge the Emperor would have lost his head.<br /><br />It is worth noting that the Samarai make a \"successful\" last stand only because they have the help of a white Westerner.  This should be enough to make the average Japanese person cringe.

The idea that honor somehow requires a military leader to ignore cutting edge military technology, i.e. firearms, or to blindly charge forward at a numerically superior and better armed foe is laughable.  Furthermore, the healing power of love can hardly be demonstrated by a widow who jumps in bed with her husband\'s killer before his corpse is even cold, even if the killer is Tom Cruise.  On a side note, I could hardly restrain my laughter when Cruise\'s character appears in the doorway of the widow\'s house wearing her husband\'s armor.  Regarding the below comments about the racially insensitive aspects of this movie, I completely agree.  If I was Japanese, I would be annoyed at how Tom Cruise\'s American character, after spending only a short time in the samurai village, ultimately holds himself out to be the highest exponent of the samurai virtues and then presumes to instruct the Emperor on how to act.

I was very excited to hear this movie was coming out. I have written several papers on the subject and not only admire Edward Zwick\'s other movies but I am a Tom Cruise fan as well. Unfortunately I was very disappointed in the movie, Tom Cruise was fantastic and the cinematography is beautiful but the film is almost completely \"factless\". America did open up trade with Japan but French and German officers trained the Japanese imperial army, they at the time had the best Foot soldiers. Also the young Emperor of Japan was not torn between the new and old ways, He instead was the driving force behind modernizing Japan as fast as it did, he saw the Samurai as one of the main reasons Japan had fallen so far behind. The Samurai that rebelled against the Emperor were considered \"RONIN\" meaning Samurai with no master, and sense Samurai means \"To serve\" they were despised by the Samurai that served the Emperor and were perceived as Dishonorable. The rebel Samurai also had full divisions that used Firearms; it was not the Bows vs. Rifles you see in the movie. And most importantly it was not the Honorable Samurai protecting the Peasant people from the heartless new way of the Evil imperial Japanese Government, quit the opposite is true. Japan had been divided for more then a century; the clans had known nothing but war. When the Shogun took power the Emperor was nothing more then a symbol and was never allowed to leave his Palace. The Shogun had the real power and the whole time it was most of Japan, the peasants and working class that suffered under the Samurai, They were Honorable warriors but only to other Samurai, ordinary Japanese were considered Less then Men and could be killed at the whims of the Samurai. It was the modernization of Japan that threatened the rule of the Samurai with the Shogun being forced to step down in 1867 and put the power back in the hands of the Emperor as well as the working class of Japan.

The Samurai armor and Katana swords in the film are beautiful, and Ken Wantanabe does a great performance in the film (I can\'t wait to see him as Ra\'s Al Ghul in Batman Begins). However, the story is downright twisted and innacurate. In real life, the Samurai were the BAD GUYS. They were arrogant and stuck up, and they were disgruntled because they were loosing their political status with the unification of Japan. The Japanese soldiers were brave, and fought valiantly and proved their worth against the Samurai in battle, and they won. The Samurai thought since they were &quot;lowly peasants&quot; they would be defeated without a struggle, but they were wrong. However, this movie completely twists around what really happened. The Samurai are portrayed as brave, moral men who want to preserve the Japanese culture and prevent &quot;westernization&quot; (which obviousely is something the director does not like), and the Japanese army is portrayed as cowardly weaklings, who the Samurai slaughter like Orcs from the Lord of the Rings. And for what? The Samurai openly admit that westernization and the extinction of Bushido is un-avoidable, so why do they see the need for a completely wasteful bloodbath that ends in hundreds of soldiers and Samurai dead? Considering how far this film goes out of it\'s way to be PC, you\'d wonder why the Samurai heroes of the film decide to go on a suicide mission and waste hundreds of lives with no real purpose. What they\'ve done to the Samurai in this movie is like if they made an Ivanhoe movie where the Normans are the good guys.

I was predisposed to like this movie, I love almost anything Akira Kurosawa has done from the Hidden Fortress, to the 7 Samurai to Ran (his masterpiece). However, unfortunately for the Last Samurai it takes more to make a movie, like a plot and characters. The screenplay is pathetic and the message is twisted and sick. Feudal Japan was great, but only if you were a samurai, you had the right of summary execution if you were insulted, (hence everyone is sooo polite), and you didn\'t have to bust your butt in the rice paddies, nice work if you can get it.  At best the movie, like the repressive society it defends is mysoginistic. Japan is better off entering the 19th century (unified country, modern medicine, less repressive society), and gets into trouble when it takes the twisted codes of bushido into the 20th century, killing prisiones (see the book The Rape of Nanking: The Forgotten Holocaust of World War II for examples of samurai honor), banzi charges and kamakazi.

I was very excited to hear this movie was coming out. I have written several papers on the subject and not only admire Edward Zwick\'s other movies but I am a Tom Cruise fan as well. Unfortunately I was very disappointed in the movies, Tom Cruise was fantastic and the cinematography is beautiful but the film is almost completely \"factless\". America did open up trade with Japan but French and German officers trained the Japanese imperial army, They at the time had the best Foot soldiers. Also the young Emperor of Japan was not torn between the new and old ways, He instead was the driving force behind modernizing Japan as fast as it did, he saw the Samurai as one of the main reasons Japan had fallen so far behind. The Samurai that rebelled against the Emperor were considered \"RONIN\" meaning Samurai with no master, and sense Samurai means \"To serve\" they were despised by the Samurai that served the Emperor and were perceived as Dishonorable. The rebel Samurai also had full divisions that used Firearms, it was not the Bows vs. Rifles you see in the movie. And most importantly it was not the Honorable Samurai protecting the Peasant people from the heartless new way of the Evil imperial Japanese Government, quit the opposite is true. Japan had been divided for more then a century, the clans had known nothing but war. When the Shogun took power the Emperor was nothing more then a symbol and was never allowed to leave his Palace. The Shogun had the real power and the whole time it was most of Japan, the peasants and working class that suffered under the Samurai, They were Honorable warriors but only to other Samurai, ordinary Japanese were considered Less then Men and could be killed at the whims of the Samurai. It was the modernization of Japan that threatened the rule of the Samurai with the Shogun being forced to step down in 1867 and put the power back in the hands of the Emperor as well as the working class of Japan. Most Samurai saw this and surrendered the old way to the new seeing that The Samurai were obsolete, but the few that rebelled were motivated by Power, status and wealth that they were losing and not for the People of Japan like the film so badly suggests. This is a fun film if you watch it as a fantasy adventure with no basis in history. I give it a low rating because even thought both Tom Cruise and Edward Zwick admit that this is not what really happened but wanted to capture the spirit of the Samurai in a fiction film, I feel this is irresponsible and that this film dishonors The real history of Japan.

Every one of these large scale epics is full of wild battles, romance, outstanding performances, and the cream of the crop celebrities.  These are the films that are especially created to win the coveted Academy Awards.  The problem is every year one film is so big, so bloated, and so prestigious it turns into a silly mess.  This year\'s film is EDWARD ZWICK\'S THE LAST SAMURAI.  A fun action film that longs to be SCHINDLER\'S LIST.<p>The Last Samurai stars Tom Cruise (Vanilla Sky) as Captain Algern, a soldier who stood with General Custer as he made his famous last stand.  While in battle he is forced to kill innocent Native American women and children, and it eats away at his soul.  Turning him to drink. <p>When his old associates give him a job training Japanese soldiers to fight against a Samurai warrior named Katsumoto (Ken Wantanabe, T.R.Y.).  Everything seems okay.  That is until he\'s captured by Katsumoto and begins to learn the law of the Samurai.<p>THE LAST SAMURAI at it\'s best boasts some of the most breathtaking close up battle scenes I\'ve seen in a long time.  I could hardly believe that for once I could follow the battles, because for the first time in a long time the camera stayed pretty steady.  It simply wasn\'t sound effects and shaky steady cams moving around.  It was real, and true battle choreography.  Now that made me smile.<p>I also loved the scene in which Algern battles a group of overzealous Japanese soldiers who are attacking his friend.  The scene actually works and is a rare sight.  A modern fight scene that doesn\'t feature wire effects or CGI.  It reminded me of old Bruce Lee movies.  A scene that was about a fight and not about special effects creating it.<p>SAMURAI also features a nice relationship between Algern and Katsumoto.  Enemies that become friends, Wantanabe\'s character is strong because it feels real.  Unlike SONNY CHIBA\'s silly turn as the proverb spouting sword dealer in KILL BILL.  Wantanabe exudes the feeling of a real Samurai and not of a silly Kung Fu movie reject.  I loved how he could embody this man who is torn between his country and his king.  <p>SAMURAIS real flaw is that it thinks it\'s SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, THE SEVEN SAMURAI, CROUCHING TIGER HIDDEN DRAGON, and DANCES WITH WOLVES, when it\'s really just a fun battle movie.  It takes itself far too seriously.  You watch it with this feeling that at any moment you\'ll see a graphic pop on the screen that says \"FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION.\"<p>It also gets the award for the silliest and most melodramatic thing screamed by an actor in peril in 2003.  Algern is going through alcohol withdrawal and screams \"SAKI\" at the top of his lungs.  I was sitting next to my brother-in-law, and every time the film hit another stupidly melodramatic moment I would whisper \"Saki!!\"  It kept me entertained.<p>I was also aghast that in front of me a small boy no more than five was sitting there.  There is a pretty gruesome scene in which a man loses his head.  Never have a felt so badly for a little child than I did when he screamed out in terror and then latched onto his mothers shoulder.  LISTEN PARENTS OF THE WORLD, THE RATING SYSTEM WAS DESIGNED SO THAT THIS KIND OF THING DOESN\'T HAPPEN.  YOU WANT TO WATCH AN R-RATED MOVIE RENT IT AT YOUR LEISURE.  DON\'T BRING A FIVE YEAR OLD TO THE MOVIES TO WATCH IT. (Calming Down) Thank you!<p>THE LAST SAMURAI is a mixed bag.  On one hand its breathtaking to watch and on the other its kinda of silly.  I\'m going to recommend it to those whom like really cool battle sequences.  But for the rest of you why not give THE SEVEN SAMURAI or even BRAVHEART a chance.  They are far better films.<p>*** out of 5'),(1444,39,'B0001G6PZC','Dallas Buyers Club','An American in Japan','Set in 1870\'s Japan, \"The Last Samurai\" is most effective when it sticks to the harsh realities of its blood- soaked battle scenes and avoids the softening effects of its two-bit philosophizing.<p>Tom Cruise is stoic and stolid as Nathan Algren, a former captain of the United States army who is having trouble coming to grips with the part he played in slaughtering a village of innocent American Indians.  Now drifting aimlessly through life, Algren disinterestedly agrees to go to Japan to help train its military in the ways of modern warfare so that the nation\'s leaders can take on and destroy the sole remnants of the samurai forces who are still using swords as weapons.  Once he is captured by the \"enemy,\" however, Algren falls under the spell of the Samurai Code of Honor and switches his allegiance in battle, ending up fighting with the samurai (whom he views as the equivalent of \"Indian underdogs\" in the struggle) against the people he was brought over to train.  The film, thus, becomes a study in redemption as this one man attempts to find his place in the scheme of things and to erase the life-crippling guilt of his past actions.<p>Director Edward Zwick, who made one of the best war films of modern times (\"Glory\"), has had less success here, mainly because he stacks the deck so shamelessly in favor of the samurai that we can\'t help feeing manipulated all throughout the film.  In many ways, \"The Last Samurai\" is as guilty of one-sidedness as those old time Westerns that used to portray the Indians as faceless savages and the White Man as noble adventurers and heroes.  Each perspective seems equally unhistorical and phony.  It\'s hard for us to see much meaning in Algren\'s redemption when the people he is following spend much of their time garroting themselves and chopping off one another\'s heads.  And all the talk about \"honor,\" \"shame,\" the beauty of cherry blossoms and getting in touch with the inner self through a zen-type lifestyle don\'t amount to too much when we stand back and realize that the samurai were basically bloody warriors who often terrorized the general populous with their acts of brutality and violence.  The makers of the film want us to see a vast moral chasm separating the samurai from both the Japanese military and the evil American colonials who support them, but it is, ultimately, a distinction without a difference.  So when we are asked to cheer on Algren and his compatriots in battle or weep over their fate, the movie loses its grip on us in a major way.  The film becomes just another case of glorifying and romanticizing a way of life that we somehow suspect was a bit less noble and honorable than we have always been led to believe by the countless movies on the subject.<p>Technically, \"The Last Samurai\" is a mighty impressive achievement.  In addition to the eye-catching vistas of rural Japan and a beautifully recreated 19th Century city, the film\'s large-scaled battle sequences have been stunningly mounted and executed - though the faint-of-heart should note that the body count on screen is enormous and the blood flows generously throughout.  There are, also, some admittedly touching moments scattered throughout the film, though the Hollywood corn is never too far from the surface (particularly in Algren\'s romantic attachment to the wife of a man he killed).<p>\"The Last Samurai\" is a joy to look at, but its unsubtle approach to its material and lack of evenhandedness make it far less meaningful and moving than, I\'m sure, it both wanted and intended to be.'),(1445,39,'B0001G6PZC','Dallas Buyers Club','Great Film, If Not Historically Accurate','In 1876, Nathan Algren (Tom Cruise) is living in a bottle.  He is a Captain in the U.S. Army who is so ashamed of the things he did in the Indian Wars under Gen. Custer that he has to constantly drink in order to forget the extremely painful memories.  Unable to keep a job, he decides to accept an offer from a Japanese noble-man.  Along with a few other military officers, including his old Colonel (Tony Goldwyn), whom Algren detests for ordering him to carry out viscious orders, and Algren\'s friend Zebulon Gant (Billy Connolly), he will travel to Japan to train the imperial army in modern warfare.  Japan is trying to modernize after centuries of isolationism, and there is a rebellion led by the Samurai, who believe that by modernizing, Japan is losing its sense of self.  The Samurai, led by Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe), will do everything they can to protect the traditional Japanese values.<br /><br />After the first battle, the poorly trained Imperial Army is massacred by the disciplined Samurai warriors, and Algren is the only soldier able to actually defend himself.  Sensing his strength, Katsumoto has him taken alive in order to be studied.  While in Katsumoto\'s village, Algren begins to discover many admirable qualities of the Samurai, including their discipline, their loyalty, and most importantly for Algren, their serenity.<br /><br />This was a great film; it dealt with loyalty, moral ambiguity, and courage.  The story, while somewhat predictable, was a good one to tell.  However, this story probably is not very accurate, but that can be overlooked.

Just Ken Watanabe\'s character. Secondly, there was this one part where you watch Tom Cruise fight some guys, then directly after, you have to watch it over again. it was supposed to add dramatic effect, but i hated it. i already saw it once, why do i have to see it again? finally, the ending sucked. it was just Tom Cruise acting like he was an angry drunk and it didn\'t make any sense why he didn\'t die. Ken Watanabe\'s character was actually cool, why did he die and Tom Cruise live? other than that, it was a pretty good film.'),(1448,40,'B0001G6PZC','Dallas Buyers Club','Tokyo goes Hollywood','First off, The Good: The cinematography, though sometimes almost TOO glossy/slick for it\'s own good, is consistently excellent, but then it is by John Toll (Braveheart, The Thin Red Line) so no surprise there.  Ken Watanabe is fine, noble, strong yet vulnerable and easily out-acts Cruise without breaking a sweat. He does more with a glance than Cruise can do with his whole grunting/straining/scowling arsenal of Master Thespian Acting tricks. In fact most of the Japanese cast is uniformly above average. Some of the battle sequences were intense and well staged, particularly the Ninja attack, but to even begin to compare them with Braveheart, as some reviewers have done here, invites incredulity.<br /><br />The Bad: Hans Zimmer\'s music nearly overwhelms several scenes in the worst sledgehammer way, underlining and cueing the audience into what emotion they should be feeling in every scene instead of merely setting and enhancing mood. Contrast this with the same composer\'s outstanding score for The Thin Red Line (incidentally a FAR superior film in every respect about men in battle/war/self-conflict). Then there\'s Mr. Tom Cruise...what to say about pretty boy? He wants that bloody Oscar SO BAD you can see him straining with the effort in nearly every scene. Several times I thought that bulging vein in his forehead was simply going to burst right there on screen. At least that would have been entertaining to watch. Cruise can be effective given the right role and a strong enough director to rein in his own worst instincts (this summer\'s Collateral for example). I\'m afraid Mr. Zwick was not up to the challenge.<br /><br />And, The Ugly: the ending. OH MY GAWD! I saw it coming and still didn\'t believe it would really go there, but yup, sure enough, Our Intrepid Hero gets to lead the suicide charge, miraculously survive it, help the REAL hero commit sepuku, stare down the emperor into shame, AND make his way back to the picture-postcard lotus blossom village to shack up with the wife of the man he killed! Alrighty then. This may have sunk to a new all time low in over-the-top, ludicrously inappropriate, spiked-on happy endings that completely invalidate everything the film has labored to create, even if unsuccessfully, for the last 150 minutes!!! Honor? If Cruise has indeed learned anything about the Samurai code of honor, he would have disemboweled himself on the last battlefield along with the other guy! But no (and I can see Mr. Cruise\'s fingerprints all over this) he has to be the defiant hero who overcomes all odds, redeems himself AND gets the girl too. Puh-leeze. Even though I was dissatisfied with much of what had come before, a decent ending could have at least redeemed the film somewhat.

I\'m tired of being masturbated upon by these modernists.  I\'m not seeing any more new movies until I see more of the great old ones.

This is BS, because the Samurai had been using guns since the 1600s just like much of the world.  This is typical for movies like it.  The poor weak natives who are nice to the earth and use thing that don\'t do little to no harm to the planet, while the big evil bad guys don\'t care and whatever they want to the earth.  I\'m not necessarily saying they did this on purpose, but it is typical.<br /><br />In closing, this movie sucks! It\'s an overly used storyline that is exactly like  Dances With Wolves, Avatar, ect.  The only difference being it\'s set in Japan.

For hundreds of years the country was ruled by a prime minister who had the title of Shogun. His rule was backed by a feudal system of armed nobles who had retinues of hereditory warriors called samurai. Samurai were of noble birth and trained in both warrior skills and an ideology of warfare.<p>The 19th Century saw the Emperor of Japan sieze power from the Shogun and to end the feudal system creating a conscript army and a modern navy. To do this he imported overseas advisors, Prussians to train the army British and French to help with the navy. The change to the power structure lead to a revolt of the samurai class upset at the loss of their traditional privalages. This film is about this revolt.<p>Being an American film the action is seen through the prism of an American officer. This of course is the first point at which we move into the land of fairy tale. At the time of the events of this film America had a small army of no great reputation. However probably Tom Cruise does a poor German accent. <p>Rather than being a drama about what happened the film is about the Tom Cruise character. That is a person who has had his soul destroyed as he has been part of a massacre of Indian women and children. This has turned him into an alcoholic who is drifting through life. In this film he is redeemed. <p>He is captured by the samurai in a battle and then kept prisoner in a remote village for the winter. In his time he becomes a convert to the samurai life style and decides to switch sides in the last epic pointless battle to keep the feudal system going in Japan. In this way he redeams himself and heal the pain of the massacre. He is also able to kill the American officer who commanded him to kill the native Americans. <p>The film is gratutously insluting to important figures in Japanese history. The emperor Meiji who was responsible for modernising his country is portrayed instead as a figure of self confidence and vision, as a dithering boy who needs Tom Cruise to help him discover the true values of his country. Cruise in talking to his feudal buddies the Samurai immediately takes on a leadership role planning the last idiotic battle and gives them tiresome lectures about the wars between the Greeks and the Persians. <p>The film is not only laboured and tiresome it is reflective of American hubris and is unhistoric in putting them at the centre of events they had no part in.'),(1468,41,'B0001G6PZC','Dallas Buyers Club','Last Samurai as seen by the racist dunb kitty','I am dumb  Truly dumb  I wish I had read more about the REAL \'Last Samurai,\' Saigo Takamori , before writing this review yesterday.

William Wallace was pumped up to cartoonish proportions, and GIVEN more than he achieved.<br /><br />In \'Dances With Wolves,\' the main character lived with the Native Americans and shared their lives...he wasn\'t put forth as influencing history and creating supposed historical fact.<br /><br />In \'The Last Samurai,\' nothing gets accomplished by the Japanese without the influence, leadership and direction of a totally artificial, Caucasian character.<br /><br />History is stripped from those who made it, and placed at the feet of Racism. Remove that White character and his supposed \'accomplishments,\' from the story, and nothing would have been done - there would have been no battle of Satsuma, Japan would have entered into a trade agreement with the US in 1876, the Samurai would be wringing their hands in the hills, wondering what to do.<br /><br />Revisionist History at its sneakiest, and most insidiously damaging, because it is not that overt.<br /><br />THe Fiction as I the dumb owner of the Crpgroup see it.<br /><br />Starring a miscast Tom Cruise as an alcoholic, wise-cracking, cocky washed-up ex-Civil War hero and former Indian Fighter who holds the rank of Captain in the U. S. Cavalry, `The Last Samurai\' opens with a dream - a white tiger battling shadowy Samurai. The tiger is leader Katsumoto `s (Ken Watanabi) standard in battle, a line of semi-interesting symbolism that is abandoned not long into the story, once it is ham-handedly flapped in our faces that the White Tiger represents Cruise\'s character.<br /><br />Katsumoto is one of the Emperor of Japan\'s last remaining links to the old ways; the leader of the rebelling Samurai and in very real danger of losing his life, either via assasination or suicide. Emperor Meiji (Shichinosuke Nakamura) is hardly more than a teenager, and simply mad for all things Western. He wishes to know everything about the West, and will drag his own people, kicking and screaming if he must, into a trade alliance. The Samurai, being loyal to the Empire, do not wish to abandon the traditional ways of the ancestors. They believe in rebelling, they are doing the greatest service for him they are capable of.<br /><br />Meet Captain Nathan Algren (Tom Cruise), a haunted man who drinks to keep his nightmares at bay, which only works somewhat. Once a celebrated Indian Fighter, he is reduced to promoting the new Winchester repeating rifles at fairs, until he loses his job after his latest oafish, dangerous performance. What is the Captain haunted by? Memories of slaughter, and bullets ripping through the bodies of Indian women and children, under the guise of military \"orders\".<br /><br />Enter Omura, (Masato Harada) The Emperor\'s advisor, aka Snidely Whiplash2. He wishes to hire Algren and his dopily evil former commanding officer, Colonel Bagley (Tony Goldwyn) to come to Japan, and teach the army there Western techniques, with Western arms and armament. In spite of the Captain\'s drunken rudeness, the offer is made and accepted, and off across the Ocean they sail.<br /><br />Upon arrival in Japan, after a nerve wracking audience with the young Emperor, Captain Algren sets out to teach the \'army,\' which consists of mostly farmers and young men, who have never handled Western firearms before. He shows them a thing or two, which leads to the setup for the Captain to lead his raw recruits against the remaining Samurai, who are in rebellion against the Emperor\'s decision to open to the West.<br /><br />The Samurai handily trounce the recruits, badly wound, then capture Captain Algren, and whisk him off to the mountains because he\'s just that cool...this takes place in early Fall.<br /><br />By early Spring, Algren has become a better Samurai than the Samurai themselves, taught himself Japanese, become the new crush of the widow of a Samurai warrior he killed and become the father-figure to her sons, taught himself Buddhism, cured his alcoholism, and battled a veteran Samurai to a draw in a pitched match-up.<br /><br />(sigh)<br /><br />See Drunken Tom.

I was very excited to hear this movie was coming out. I have written several papers on the subject and not only admire Edward Zwick\'s other movies but I am a Tom Cruise fan as well. Unfortunately I was very disappointed in the movie, Tom Cruise was fantastic and the cinematography is beautiful but the film is almost completely \"factless\". America did open up trade with Japan but French and German officers trained the Japanese imperial army, They at the time had the best Foot soldiers. Also the young Emperor of Japan was not torn between the new and old ways, He instead was the driving force behind modernizing Japan as fast as it did, he saw the Samurai as one of the main reasons Japan had fallen so far behind. The Samurai that rebelled against the Emperor were considered \"RONIN\" meaning Samurai with no master, and sense Samurai means \"To serve\" they were despised by the Samurai that served the Emperor and were perceived as Dishonorable. The rebel Samurai also had full divisions that used Firearms, it was not the Bows vs. Rifles you see in the movie. And most importantly it was not the Honorable Samurai protecting the Peasant people from the heartless new way of the Evil imperial Japanese Government, quit the opposite is true. Japan had been divided for more then a century, the clans had known nothing but war. When the Shogun took power the Emperor was nothing more then a symbol and was never allowed to leave his Palace. The Shogun had the real power and the whole time it was most of Japan, the peasants and working class that suffered under the Samurai, They were Honorable warriors but only to other Samurai, ordinary Japanese were considered Less then Men and could be killed at the whims of the Samurai. It was the modernization of Japan that threatened the rule of the Samurai with the Shogun being forced to step down in 1867 and put the power back in the hands of the Emperor as well as the working class of Japan. Most Samurai saw this and surrendered the old way to the new seeing that The Samurai were obsolete, but the few that rebelled were motivated by Power, Status and Wealth that they were losing and not for the People of Japan like the film so badly suggests. This is a fun film if you watch it as a fantasy adventure with no basis in history. I give it a low rating because even thought both Tom Cruise and Edward Zwick admit that this is not what really happened but wanted to capture the spirit of the Samurai in a fiction film, I feel this is irresponsible and that this film dishonors The real history of Japan. I would like to add that the Chinese feel Honoring the Samurai and Japanese values is like Honoring Nazis and their way of life and I don\'t blame them for feeling that way.'),(64804,42,'B0001G6PZC','Dallas Buyers Club','Omg...very hurtful and insulting.','This is the most upseting movie I have ever watched in my life.

How is it that at the end of the battle scene Tom Cruise is left alive while the rest of the samurai were massacred? How? Tell me. And how is it that Taka and her children fell in love with the man that murdered the most important man of their lives. And people claim this is such an amazing tribute to the Japanese culture. Thats to someone that is completely ignorant. First off, a person should already be proud of their heritage, and what great tribute is there? Sure they make the samurai seem like peaceful people, but why then is it that a foriegner that learned little in a few months was able to survive and become the last samurai. It was all BS.

Loosely based on fact, the real last samurai, Saigo Takamori, that this movie is based on was a terrible murderer who held tightly to an incredibly conservative viewpoint (translation: racist) and wanted Japan to wage war against Korea.  Later, it was this same superiority complex and \"conservative\" sentiment that ultimately influenced Japan to rape and massacre China, Korea and much of Asia in a holocaust campaign bested only by Hitler\'s Nazi Germany.

But one day in battle, he is wounded and captured by the enemy.  The strength and determination Algren shows in defending himself against the samurai fascinates the leader of the samurai, Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe).  Katsumoto begins speaking with Algren and learning more about him, and Algren finds himself slowly learning the way of the samurai and adopting the lifestyle of the villagers around him.  As the story unfolds, he begins turning more and more into a samurai and eventually winds up fighting for them.<p>The lowdown:<br />Edward Zwick, who made \"Glory\" directs this film with the eye of an artist. The entertaining film moves at a brisk pace, and it is always fascinating to watch Algren\'s character change as he sees another world in a village perched high on a mountain in supposedly \"enemy\" territory.  The film\'s beautiful colors and long shots, brought to life by the great John Toll (Thin Red Line), takes us to a world of another day.  The other highlight is the score by Hans Zimmer, one of my favorite composers (Black Hawk Down, Thin Red Line, etc.)  These two technical aspects help the film a great deal, and help draw us into the conflicting worlds of old Japan and new Japan; the artillery and the samurai sword.  The vivid imagery brings to mind the great films of Kurosawa; the heavy rain dripping down a thatched roof or two men practicing a duel on a field high on a mountain reminds us of \"Seven Samurai;\" the long shots of samurai colors and soldiers resembles \"Kagemusha\" and \"Ran.\"  Tom Cruise does a fine job in the role of Algren, though I think another actor would have been more fitting, as Cruise is more of a modern and contemporary actor.  Even his voice is just too modern to be thrown into the late 1800s.  But still, he makes his character convincing.  The Japanese actors, especially Watanabe help the film a lot.<br /> With that said, this is a very good movie, but not a great one.  The film panders to  clich&eacute;s and Hollywood formulas too much at times, and the script is nearly not as deep as the visuals.  At times, Zwick seems to walk the thin line between being an artist and a hack.  The characters and dialogue are adequate, but not profound or heavily insightful like \"Lawrence of Arabia\" (an unfair comparison for any movie) or even recently \"Master and Commander.\"  I mention these two films, because these are both grand epics that are as focused on their characters and conflicts as they are with action and battle scenes.  Deep character development is key in a story like this, because there are many conflicts within: A man searching for identity, a battle between an old and new world, a battle between cultures.  The film does not delve deeply enough into these matters, but it is still entertaining and at times even thought-provoking.  The battle scenes are well staged, but those who have seen a Kurosawa movie, specifically \"Seven Samurai,\" \"Kagemusha,\" or \"Ran,\" probably might start thinking of those films upon watching this.  One can\'t help but think as grand and spectacular Kurosawa\'s colors and battle scenes were, there lay a heart, a soul, a deep meaning about life and people behind those epic canvas shots of war and blood.  There was a message about life in all of Kurosawa\'s films, and here a rather straightforward story is told in a clear-cut manner.<br /> There are quiet, reflective, and beautiful moments, such as Algren journaling his thoughts as he observes the Japanese village around him, or Algren adopting the way of the samurai.  And as I said before, all these scenes are fueled by great cinematography by John Toll and powerful music by Hans Zimmer.<br /> This is a flawed epic, but not a mess like last year\'s much anticipated \"Gangs of New York.\"  \"The Last Samurai\" scratches the surface of the many great samurai films and Kurosawa\'s depth and is not as multi-layered as it should be, but there is enough fighting and entertainment to keep mainstream audiences content.  Nevertheless, the film is beautiful to look at, entertaining, well-done, and as I said before, has an amazing soundtrack (see my review of the soundtrack).

This is one of the few recent productions in which the masculine is portrayed in a wholesome manner:  the warrior spirit, the camaraderie, the honor, and the respect for the inner peace that is brought by zen meditation practice, are brought out very well.  <p>While the script was IMO kinda clichey & mediocre, Cruise\'s acting was not bad and rather subtle for a scientologist  :)  Zimmer\'s music was predictably good (if less conspicuous as in, say, Black Hawk Down) and if you\'re into kendo or swordsmanship, well, you will want to see this film several times.'),(64812,43,'B0001G6PZC','Dallas Buyers Club','Of Shame  and Honor - Cruise\'s Conflict','This movie is a very interesting look at opportunism, guilt and shame on the one hand and opportunity, pride and honor on the other.  The irony throughout the movie was a comparing of these things within two cultural frameworks.  The clash between the old world being encroached upon by a new world.  <p>The comparison between the opportunism of the US against the native American tribes compared to the resistance of the old world Japanese Samurai was fascinating to say the least.  The characters that were played by Watanabe and Cruise were very much linked through similar issues but from vastly different persepectives.<p>Cruise plays a US Calvary Captain (Nathan Algren) who is tormented by his past and when he goes to Japan on a mercenary mission to assist the Emperor\'s minions in defeating the last hold out of the old ways he is forced to see himself and the world he is from through a different lens.<p>The cavalier versus the discipline and strength of the Samurai are showed over again.  Algren goes through a metamorphasis of sorts.  It is a different look at the issues of east versus west.<p>At varying points in the film, Algren is seen going through a conflict in his mind that torments him.  He is seen running from and with this scene playing within his psyche at all times.  His torment reaches it\'s climax in his captivity.  That is where the story changes and a man is free.  <p>The issues that contain the ironies are things to look for, the western ways of expediency and convenience versus the eastern ways of patience.  Katsumoto (Watanabe) has a righteous anger, yet you need to listen carefully to his raging with the Emperor.....<p>Algren finds himself in a new world and a new mentality.  I was left to wonder if there is a metaphor regarding today\'s east verse west conflict.  Today, some of the west come to adopt eastern ideology and even side with those in conflict with their societies.  It seems more that Cruise is accepting a cause than anything else and releases himself from his torment.<p>The movie reflects a full range of emotion from sorrow, to anger to love and deep reflection.  This is rated R yet only for the violence and some language, there is no sex, no nudity and very little language and some of what is spoken is almost humorous.  Billy Connoly looks like John Cleese.  He has a few lines that come across funny to a degree.<p>Tony Goldwyn plays Cruise\'s alter-ego who stays in character throughout.  <p>The battle scenes, from the two larger battles to the one small skirmish are pictured very intensely.  I wonder if the scenes showing the battle between the Samurai and the newly formed Japanese army are really a reflection of the American Indian fighting the US Army in the great Indian wars.  It is from the same timeframe and to me it seems possible that the message was easier to get across so that it would be acceptable for those who are resistant to politically correct messages.<p>The basic story though is well thought out and well presented.  I would have rated it a 5 and many would do so as well, yet the \"BraveHeart\" type violence to me is getting a little worn thin.  The sheer violence of the small battle that ensued in Tokyo was enough to show intensity and bravado. The scene of hand to hand combat was appropriate and realistic.  I particularly was impressed with the intense desire to live shown in that scene.<p>The sensation of emotion is very intense in this film and sensationalism was not necessary for me.<p>I will watch this movie again and will add it to my wish list.'),(64813,43,'B0001G6PZC','Dallas Buyers Club','Wow!

He reluctantly agrees to train and lead an army of Japanese soldiers to defeat rebellion of the country\'s remaining Samurai. Unfortunately, Algren is captured in battle by the Samurai, and is held prisoner by them. The leader of the Samurai, Katsumoto ( Ken Watanabe), is interested in the American culture and wants to keep Algren alive to learn from him. As time passes, Algren comes to develop a friendship with Katsumoto. He also comes to embrace the Samurai way of life as well, and trains to become one of them, so that he can fight along side of the Samurai against the Japanese forces that oppose them.<p>With the acception of \"Mystic River\", \"The Last Samurai\" was my favorite film of 2003. For 2 1/2 hours, I was literally glued to the screen, and loving every minute of it. It has been quite some time since I have been that captivated by a film. The only downfall this film may have, is the fact that the story is almost a complete rip off of \"Dances with Wolves\". However, that does not make the film any less enjoyable. In fact, \"The Last Samurai\" is almost better. The story comes across as being much more dramatic and action packed when dealing with the Samurai. They have a deeper sense of honor, and their fighting style is much more deadly. Director Edward Zick did an amazing job of capturing every aspect of the Samurai culture, from the costume designs and simple way of life, to the weaponry and fighting style. The final battle between the Samurai and the Japanese soldiers is the best I have seen since \"Braveheart\". The Samurai are completely outnumbered, and still manage to put up one heck of a fight. Tom Cruise gave one of the best, if not the best performance of his career. However, the best performance of the film goes to Ken Watanabe. He was flat out amazing as Katsumoto and nailed every aspect of the Samurai warrior. The film\'s soundtrack and scenery are extremely beautiful as well.<p>Overall, \"The Last Samurai\" is an amazing film. Every aspect of the Samurai way of life is captured accurately, the performances given by the actors involved were amazing, and the final battle was incredible. Also, please check out the extras listed by Amazon for this 2 Disc DVD set. From the look of things, the extras are reason enough to purchase this film. There are deleted scenes, featurettes on the making of the film, a featurette comparing real life Samurai, and more. This is definately a bonus for myself and anyone else who appreciates the film, and the Samurai in general.<p>A solid 5 stars...'),(64815,43,'B0001G6PZC','Dallas Buyers Club','Flawed, but worthy','A disillusioned, alcoholic American soldier (Tom Cruise) hires out as a mercenary in Japan to put down the rebellion of a samurai leader (Ken Watanabe), but instead he comes to admire their ways and joins them in their struggle.  This is a deeply flawed film that nevertheless has many fine points to recommend it.  It is a rousing adventure with stirring battle scenes.  The photography, costuming, and production design are astonishing, presenting a convincing and fascinating portrait of samurai culture and Japanese peasant life.  The cast is mostly excellent, especially Watanabe, who should be remembered at Oscar time.<br /><br />However, there are two things that work against this film.  The first is Tom Cruise himself.  Although he does good work here, he just seems to be too lightweight as an actor to grapple convincingly with the issues of guilt and redemption that torment his character.  The biggest problem is the film\'s ending, which eschews an honest resolution in favor of Hollywood convention.  Nevertheless, the things that work in this film really work well, resulting in a entertaining and worthy feature./'),(64816,43,'B0001G6PZC','Dallas Buyers Club','good Hollywood movie','I wouldn\'t say that this movie is some extraodinary creation - just typical well-done Hollywood production. In different backgrounds the same kind of movie was played already a few times. The fighting scenes are great. Tom Cruise is good. Japanesse background is exciting. The major points in the history are correct. I have only two complains. First, the fighting parties are potrayed in white and black: not everything was positive and romantic in samurais as well as their enemies weren\'t so bad always. Second, the ending was too much even by Hollywood measures. All in all, even it\'s not a masterpiece I still enjoyed watching it.'),(64817,43,'B0001G6PZC','Dallas Buyers Club','The Last Samurai [Blu-ray]','This movie is wonderful in Blu-ray and DTS digital surround. These formats were created for movies with great vistas and battle scenes, which abound here.  It\'s a movie about honor, bravery, nobility and redemption.  Along the way we have subplots including the clash of civilizations in 19th century Japan, a tender, thought-provoking love story, an action thriller and a buddy movie between the Tom Cruise character, Captain Algren and the Samurai warrior, Lord Katsumoto, played by Ken Watanabe, who gives a better performance than Cruise, IMO.<br /><br />I\'m not Tom Cruise\'s biggest fan.  I consider him to be more of a movie star than he is an actor, yet I keep finding myself watching and enjoying his movies and this is my favorite.  He did a fine job in this movie, however. Not perfect but not much is. It was a difficult part, in that he had to convincingly portray a man going through major changes.  The redemption I mentioned, had to have been emotionally challenging for the actor. He did all his own stunts, btw.<br /><br />The direction, filming and editing is as good as anything you\'re going to see.  The Blu-ray transfer was excellent.  The sets, primarily in the Warner Bros lot in Burbank and in New Zealand were outstanding.

If you\'re new to Bollywood, this may not be the best place to start, but believe it or not this was my first Bollywood movie and I fell in love right away.Romantic movies with great music.

I can\'t say I would have even looked this up if it wasn\'t for the opening Dance-musical number that was made famous in the opening of the movie Ghost World. This movie has the complete original version of that fun, catchy Dance Tune, that is also recently used in the latest Hienikin Beer Commercial. This is a very unusual movie, not for all tastes, and the majority of the tunes are India 60\'s style Romance and Pop type tunes. Kinda whiney, as they go.

While it was obviously meant as a mystery/thriller (IMDB also reports the script was based on Agatha Christie\'s Ten Little Indians, which would bring new latitude to the definition of the term \"loose\"), watching it forty-five years later, Gumnaam has all the hallmarks of a classic unintentional comedy. This would have been great fodder for MST3K. (Note to self: get ahold of the Cinematic Titanic team....)<br /><br />Plot: at the beginning of the movie, we see a man murdered. The guy who seems to be behind it contacts a series of people by phone before being murdered himself. Cut to the Princess Club, a dance joint where we get the first of those oddly inappropriate musical numbers germane to Bollywood flicks. The dance is great, and if you\'re a Bones fan, the lead dancer could pass for Michaela Conlin\'s mom. (That alone might be reason enough for you to catch this. Mrow!) Afterwards, the MC gets up and announces the winners of a lucky draw, who will be sent on an all-expenses-paid vacation to... well, we\'re never told where. Not that it matters; after a spat of \"engine trouble\" (we see the pilot obviously fiddling with the controls), they all land on an island somewhere in the Indian Ocean (I think, may have been the South Pacific). Everyone gets out to stretch their legs, including the co-pilot, Anand (Manoj Kumar, already a superstar by 1965; he played the title role in Shaheed earlier that year). Once everyone\'s clear, the pilot suddenly takes off, leaving his hapless charges on what seems to be an abandoned island. Among them is Asha (Prem Rog\'s Nanda), the niece of the murdered man from the opening scene, whom mastermind-guy had called to offer his condolences (and gloat?) just before being shot. We also have a lawyer named Rakesh (Bobby\'s Pran, who gets the Best Beard in Bollywood award); a doctor, Acharaya (Pyaar ka Saagar\'s Madan Puri); a party girl, Miss Kitty (Bombay 405 Miles\' Helen--the only member of this cast to still have a career, appearing in the upcoming Dunno y na Jaane Kyun..., which opens October 22, 2010); Dharamdas, who may have another job but passes his time on the island indulging in his passion for fishing (Brahmachari\'s Dhumal); Madhusudan (Benazir\'s Tarun Bose), who... um, I never quite caught what he did; and Kishan (Kathputli\'s Man Mohan), an alcoholic who\'s got a thing for Miss Kitty. The party eventually stumble upon a large mansion in the middle of a jungle, where they\'re greeted by a Hitler-hairstyle-wearing butler (Dev Anand in Goa\'s Mehmood) who tells them he\'s been expecting their arrival...<br /><br />It\'s a lot of characters to throw at you in rapid succession, and one of the movie\'s greatest successes is that you get to know who\'s who pretty quickly, and they all have distinct personalities that shine through rather than being a muddle of interchangeable serial killer fodder. On the flip side of this is the plot, which is outlandish from the beginning, but truly begins to fall apart about forty-five minutes before the end of the movie, and really comes unglued during the climax. There\'s a certain type of ending to a mystery that is, to be blunt, a complete cheat, and this one utilizes it. And then there are the oddly inappropriate musical numbers; while they\'re not as oddly out of place here as they are in, say, Rain: The Terror Within (nothing like a musical number during an attempted rape!), it doesn\'t matter how awesome the scenery and how warm the rain, breaking into a song about frustrated love just doesn\'t seem right when you\'ve discovered a dead body, you know? Still, despite its serious shortcomings (and I rush to add the bulk of the movie\'s rating comes from that very, very severe plot defect mentioned above), there\'s a lot to like about this flick. It\'s very easy on the eyes, the dialogue is witty, the butler is the intentional part of the hilarity (and does his job well every time he\'s onscreen), and if you\'re a smoker, you\'ll wax nostalgic for the days when everyone pulled out cigars and pipes at the dinner table. Oh, and the peer pressure in this movie is great (while, again, nothing as outrageous as in Rain, some of the interplay between Kitty [\"I like alcoholics, but I don\'t like alcohol!\"] and Kishan [\"Just drink this one little one... for me...\"] could easily be construed as coercive; the easily-triggered should take note).<br /><br />In short: if you\'re a bad movie connoisseur, this is must viewing. Others, take or leave at will. * +-'),(64824,45,'B000IZJR3I','Frequencies','GUMNAMM','THIS WAS AN AWESOME MOVIE, IT WAS BETTER THAN EXPECTED.  THE DANCE SCENES WILL FOREVER BE IN MY MIND.

Venus Versus Virus is exactly one such title.  Here we have a gun-shooting demon-buster teenage girl with teal hair and an eye patch charged with saving all of humanity from an evil virus outbreak.  If this sounds a little strange to you, rest assured, things get even weirder once you\'re in.  In the mean time, let\'s check out the specs shall we?<br /><br />Released across two discs, Venus Versus Virus contains the complete series (12 episodes) and comes packaged in a single regular-sized dvd case.  Total runtime comes in at 290 minutes and the show wears an appropriate if not slightly conservative TV 14 rating due presumably to the gun touting and semi violent themes presented.  Graphic gore, nudity, and sexual themes are nonexistent here.<br /><br />Extras come in the form of textless songs and a crop of upcoming Funimation title trailers on the second disc.  Language options are typical sub and dub meaning the choice between running the original Japanese dialog or an English dubbed version and the option to show English subtitles over either track.<br /><br />The story follows the exploits of the Venus Vanguard organization, or more specifically, the eye patch wearing goth-girl Lucia and her teenage recruit Sumire as they bust the bad guys with their pistols.  Bad guys in this case refers to possessed critters and people who are basically carriers of an \"evil\" virus.  Sumire, it turns out, has a unique ability in that the bullets our heroines use to kill these viruses have an effect on her as well.  In addition to being one of few who can actually see the viruses for what they really are, when shot with an anti-virus slug, Sumire enters a berserker rage mode that allows her to whip some major demon buttocks.  Still, despite this, she desires only to lead an ordinary life.<br /><br />The problem is the stone-cold gothic business-woman Lucia isn\'t about to allow all of this talent to go wasted and hence recruits young Sumire into the Venus Vanguard sect to rid the world of demons everywhere.<br /><br />The pacing is consistent if not entirely linear with some adequate flashback sequences peppered in the mix for good measure.  Visuals too are passable but nothing worth getting too excited over.  Of course, shows like this aren\'t purchased for visual flair but rather for their unique spin on what boils down to a character-driven drama.  In that regard Venus Versus Virus is fair as well.  If you notice a pattern forming here, it is perhaps that the VVV report card is loaded with average grades which, if you\'ll remember from school, doesn\'t get you grounded but doesn\'t exactly get you praised either.<br /><br />The show relies upon a lot of character clich&eacute; to get its point across.  Take Lucia for example, with an outwardly cold persona to hide the fact that inside she\'s warm and marshmallowy just like everyone else.  Sumire is your average school girl who wants nothing more than to worry about boys, zits and going to the prom but happens to be both blessed and burdened by a unique ability that makes her invaluable to the struggle against evil.  The evil in question is at times playful and has a little bit too much in common with the type of ghosts one would expect to find in a Disney-themed haunted house than the whole Buffy the Vampire Slayer theme the show seems to have been aiming for.<br /><br />Dub work is pretty solid although clearly the ADV Films\' English track remains on this Funimation release.  I say this because generally speaking, Funimation\'s dubs are a cut above the rest.  The soundtrack goes out of its way to use eerie tones and suspenseful melodies to remind viewers that this is supposed to be a little scarier than the bright visuals suggest.<br /><br />In all, this is an interesting little series that makes the most out of what limited resources it was given.  Since it is limited only to twelve episodes, the type of character development and all-inclusive closure episodes are never fully established.  Instead the trip through is quite light and airy in its prose with just enough \"chicks shooting guns\" action to lighten up the whole gothic motif.'),(64826,45,'B0023S4A12','Fruitvale Station','Not the best adaptation actually.

The two end differently, in popular opposite ways, and they even begin differently. Only a few events are based off manga events.<br /><br />The ending will leave you short and sad.

So much so, I actually seeked out the original ADV release, with the three single discs and wonderful artbox (besides Bandai\'s magnetic artboxes, I think ADV comes in second with the sturdiest and coolest artboxes); instead of the usual black, clear or sometimes white colour case, the older ADV release came in never-before-seen-by-me light blue-like cases, which goes great with the whole dark, gothic look of the packaging; one thing good about boxed sets being released, the original material is cheaper to hunt down in the long run -- however, this double clear case 2-disc holder of this release was a nice change and surprise from the recent slimcase phenomenon that never protects the disc(s).<br /><br />I also haven\'t read the manga, so maybe I remain ignorant; but evenso, I tend to enjoy my visual medium different than the written material, it leaves both to be special in their own right.  So I could care less if the anime takes liberty on storytelling or changes up the characters.  Crucify me.  With that being said, even after the first episode, I was attracted to and very much sucked in by the quick character development and the mysteries that shrouded around certain personalities.  I mean, come-on... an antique dealer (Lucia, a one woman Venus Vangaurd) storefront owner who takes on clients that see Virus-es (evil spirits - similar to xxxHolic) and runs a backroom where equipment is developed to fight off these corrupt souls?!?  Sign me up.<br /><br />And then the sweet character girl Sumire, who at times needs to turn beserk-er (Claymore anyone?) in order to further battle the attacking Virus?  After being enthralled by such side characters as the cute soulless dolls in xxxHolic, and the battle drone soulless dolls of Murder Princess (another great 6 episode series), I was pleasantly surprised to be introduced to Laura/Lola and her twin sister... another great pair of soulless twin dolls.  Bonus.  I also have no problem with the hard-shelled bad-arse protagonist of the show ending up with somewhat of a hidden human-soft-side.

The two marry anyway, and spendthrift Aubrey is unable to support his bride on a clerk\'s pay.<br /><br />After he wins a car in a raffle, Aubrey (who doesn\'t know how to operate it) causes several accidents by driving on the wrong side of the road. In the process of crashing the auto, Aubrey pins a traffic cop against a wall. In court he\'s unable to pay a $1,000 fine, so his brother Joe (Kelly) helps out, which causes a whole new set of problems.<br /><br />In 1946, Red Skelton starred in one of the many remakes of <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/630294659X\">THE SHOW OFF</a> (1946).

There are alot of sexy girls in this video!'),(64839,47,'1888617047','The Great Beauty','Unlocks the Keyboard for Everyone!','The beginning of the video gives an important history lesson, reminding us that many of the great composers did not learn by rote lessons and first reading music.  The piano was a new invention and as such the people who first took a stab at it, played around on it.  They didn\'t have any music to read from at first, they hadn\'t even written any.  They played, experimented with chords and rhythms and combinations, got to know the keyboard inside out.  THEN they started writing down their music.  <p>It was only after people liked what they heard the composers doing that they wanted in on the action &quot;I want to do that too!&quot;  So companies started producing sheet music and from simple to complex arrangements that laypeople could play.  That\'s when piano &quot;lessons&quot; started.  But playing is like learning to talk.  First you learn to talk and you know the reason for language is to communicate.  You watch and listen to others around you, you mimic and emulate, practice and get it wrong a lot before you get it right.  Suddenly it becomes &quot;natural&quot; because you\'ve used it EVERY day!  After that, learning to spell and to read make sense.  <p>The premise of this instruction is that the same holds true with playing the piano.  It\'s drudgery starting to learn scales before you\'ve been motivated by first making music.  Experiment first and learn to play through experiencing how the different sounds on the keyboard relate to one another.  It\'s an excellent foundation on which to build.  <p>I learned a lot through this video and recommend it highly.  It provides a needed understanding on how to go about learning the piano in a way that makes it fun for life and has a casual, one on one feel to it.'),(64840,47,'1888617047','The Great Beauty','The best piano course','My seven year old son wanted to learn piano, so I bought a traditional piano book for children--he ended up in tears. I was searching for a way to teach him which wouldn\'t destroy his passion and creativity, or steal his joy of learning. While walking through the library, the title \"Piano for Quitters\" caught my eye. Within days, my son was writing beautiful chord progressions and asking for \"music practice\" to be added to his daily work chart so he could play the piano before his other jobs were done. Our whole family is now learning to play the piano and loving it! I am a former piano quitter--I managed to survive one year of traditional piano lessons, and tried various other piano methods, but by using Piano for Quitters (and it\'s sequal: Piano for Life), I am learning to play beautiful music along with my children and husband.'),(64841,47,'1888617047','The Great Beauty','Piano for Quitters','Great product!

There is no escaping the fact, however, that even the best instant oatmeal is nowhere near as good as even a store brand of oatmeal requiring stovetop preparation.  Still, the McCann\'s is as good as it gets for instant oatmeal. It\'s even better than the organic, all-natural brands I have tried.  All the varieties in the McCann\'s variety pack taste good.  It can be prepared in the microwave or by adding boiling water so it is convenient in the extreme when time is an issue.<br /><br />McCann\'s use of actual cane sugar instead of high fructose corn syrup helped me decide to buy this product.  Real sugar tastes better and is not as harmful as the other stuff. One thing I do not like, though, is McCann\'s use of thickeners.  Oats plus water plus heat should make a creamy, tasty oatmeal without the need for guar gum. But this is a convenience product.  Maybe the guar gum is why, after sitting in the bowl a while, the instant McCann\'s becomes too thick and gluey.'),(34,5,'B001EO5QW8','McCanns Oatmeals','Good Instant','This is a good instant oatmeal from the best oatmeal brand.  It uses cane sugar instead of high fructouse corn syrup, so not only does it have a better sweetness, but some doctors now say that this form of sugar is better for you.  Great on a cold morning when you don\'t have time to make McCann\'s Steel Cut Oats.  The apple cinnamon is the best but the maple and brown sugar or the regular are good too.

What I personally like about McCann\'s is that it cooks up thicker and with more body than the top brand here in America. The Apples & Cinnamon, though, tends to be a little liquidy so you may want to experiment with the amount of water you add. In my 1300watt microwave the oatmeal cooks up in about one minute and twenty-seven seconds, so you should also watch that to get a handle on how much time and water to use.<br />  The only bad thing -- if you can consider it a bad thing -- about this offering is that you have to buy in lot so you\'ll end up with six ten-count boxes.

Nausea, diarrhea & headaches can also be experienced. I learned my lesson the hard way years ago when I fell in love with the sugar-free chocolates suzanne sommers used to sell.  I thought I\'d found sugar-free chocolate nirvana at first taste but the bliss was short lived when the terrible side effects of maltitol kicked in.  The discomfort was unlike anything I had ever felt before.  I blew up like a balloon and had very painful abdominal cramping.  As the symptoms passed, this too was very unpleasant.  Though hard for me to believe a low calorie sweetener could be the culprit, all symptoms were gone when I stopped eating the chocolate. My hunch it had something to do with the maltitol were unfortunately confirmed for me about a year later when I purchased some delicious sugar-free popcorn at my local market.  The taste was amazing and while I was looking at the label wondering what could possibly make this yummy, new sugarfree treat taste so good, my heart sank when I followed the little asterisk next to sugarfree sweetener* down to the very bottom of the label and read \"maltitol\" in tiny little letters! Thank goodness I\'d eaten only a little. I still ended up with all the same side-effects but for a much shorter duration. Some people can use maltitol to their heart\'s content but others, like me, can have a bad reaction to it.

I have been looking for this for a while now, not for food science, but for something more down to earth.  I use it to make my own coffee creamer.<br /><br />I have to have my coffee blonde and sweet - but the flavored creamers are full of the bad kinds of fat, and honestly, I hate to use manufactured \"food\" items.  I really don\'t think they are good for the body.  On the other hand, I hate using cold milk or cream, because I like HOT coffee.<br /><br />I stumbled across this on Amazon one day and got the idea of making my own creamer.  I also bought low-fat (non-instant) milk powder and regular milk powder. The non-instant lowfat milk is a little sweeter and tastes fresher than regular instant low-fat milk, but does not dissolve good in cold water - which is not a problem for hot coffee.  You will have to play with the ratios - I would not do just the heavy cream, it made the coffee too rich. Also, I think the powder is too expensive to just use on it\'s own. I like mixing 1/3 of each together.<br /><br />For flavoring, I bough cocoa bean powder, vanilla bean powder, and caster (superfine) sugar.  I mix up small batches along with spices like cinnamon and nutmeg to make my own flavored creamers.  If you wanted, you could use a fake sweetner powder instead.  I make up small amounts that I store in jelly canning jars. I also use my little food chopper/food processor to blend everything, so the sugar is not heavier and sinks to the bottom.  Let it settle for a bit before opening the top though.<br /><br />This stuff tastes WAY better than the storebought creamers and it is fun to experiment and come up with your own flavors.  I am going to try using some essential oils next and see if I can get a good chocolate/orange mix.<br /><br />All of the ingredients I mentioned are here online.  Take the time to experiment.  Maybe you don\'t use any low-fat milk. Or don\'t add any flavorings.  It is up to you.  Also, would make great housewarming/host(ess) gifts.<br /><br />I am sure other molecular people will be able to tell you more of what you can do with it, and I am sure I will experiment with it in cooking - but the main reason I bought it was to make my own creamer and it worked out great.'),(84,12,'B0019CW0HE','Frozen Food','Natural Balance Lamb and Rice','While my dogs like all of the flavors that we have tried of this Frozen Food, for some reason their itching increased when I tried the lamb and rice.

They love whatever we feed them.<br /><br />This review is based on what we, their affectionate owners love. After a certain age, we were instructed by the vet to consider senior foods- and lower carb foods, because the catties were fatties. We tried a few types of food. Some evinced no change. Some made the litter super-stink.  Some had too small a kibble and the cats barfed it up because they didn\'t have to chew it to swallow it...<br /><br />This Felidae has done the trick. No problems to speak of. It is consistent in the litter and bearable on the nose. The cats love it. The kibble is sized appropriate to chewing. And here\'s the kicker:<br />After feeding the cats Felidae, their demeanor improved. Their coats are super soft and lush- both are new improvements we can directly attribute to this food. We\'re now loyal Felidae consumers.<br /><br />Additionally, the absence of corn product in the feed seems to lessen or remove the reactions of our friends with cat-allergies.'),(211,40,'B0009XLVGA','Felidae Platinum-Frozen Food','My cat loves it!','I started my cat on Felidae Platinum about 3 weeks ago and she loves it.

She\'s now been on just the Felidae for about ten days now, off the old food entirely, and she is a much sweeter, happier cat. I think it must agree with her better or be more easily digested, or something. In any case, I am a happy purchaser of Felidae. I don\'t agree with the previous reviewer that cats don\'t like it.

The other two are arthritic and skinny.<br /><br />Since we had such success with Canidae Platinum for senior dogs, I figured that we\'d give it a try for our cats.  I\'d had them on low ash Purina One Urinary tract formula for their entire lives and thankfully we had no UT problems.<br /><br />Buster, the youngest, is still a blob after six months plus on Felidae for Senior and Overweight cats.  However, the other two are now much more active and we can tell that they are really \"feeling better\" since we changed their food to Felidae.  Even Prissy, the ancient one has started to play and tease the dogs by getting them to chase her, where before when she was on Purina One, all she wanted to do was to sleep.<br /><br />I think that if you can get your cat on this fairly early in their weight problems, it\'ll be more effective.<br /><br />However, the glucosamine will certainly help your older fur balls have a happier life.'),(213,41,'B0009XLVGA','Felidae Platinum-Frozen Food','Nearly killed the cats','Too much of a good thing?

(As you will notice I have also reviewd the Canidae, and this all happened the same time the dogs were having issues.)<br /><br />Prior to the change in food we had almost lost two of our cats because we had moved to a new home.  If cats get \"upset\" because of a change in enviorment, or a loud noise they can stop eating.  It depends on the cat.  Two of them had stopped eating and had lost a lot of weight.  We took them to the vet and it took months to get them back to normal.  It has been a year since then and they are better.  Then the formula for this food changed.<br /><br />We started to noitce they were not eating as much and it started to bug us.  We asked the shop owner of the feed store and she had no knowledge of any change to the food.  It wasn\'t until the we were in there with other customers yelling about their dogs food making their dogs sick.  Right away we changed the cats food and they started chowing down and haven\'t suffered one bit like our dogs have.<br /><br />Cats are sensitve animals and changes to thier food could cause them to stop eating.  Anyone thinking of purchasing this food should not do it!  We have 5 rescued and fixed cats, none of which are picky eaters and the change in this formula could have been the death of them had we not found out about the change in their formula.<br /><br />I urge anyone that has had these problems to go to the consumer affairs website and also the FDA website and write a letter to them to let them know how this has affected your animal.

I called their hotline to complain and was told that they had had a problem with their recent sugar crop and that the result was less molasses in the sugar. They have had many complaints of a similar nature. This, they claimed, also reduced the crystal size. They said this problem should go away with their newer crop. The representative said that the new-crop sugar will have a 6-10 digit date code (without ANY spaces) that ends with a \"1\" and no letters. The trailing digits are a date code using the Julian calendar. (My recent bad-purchase had a space after the initial sequence of numbers and then ended with a \"51A\").

The flavor is tremendous, although I wouldn\'t describe it as Thai.  It\'s more of a vague, sweet and tangy flavor with a kick, and every now and then you get a great big hit of ginger.

I was finding it odd that they were on sale so much but took advantage of it.  After opening the bag I found the chips were not even close to the Kettle chips I was used to.  They were all uniform whitish yellow in color, flavor was way off, the lovely extra crisp brown chips were gone completely and I was very disappointed.  So I e-mailed Kettle with the following:  \"What Happened? I bought this bag of chips the other day and they have a very different taste; It tastes \"cheaper\". I don\'t know how else to put it... I also noticed that the chips seemed to be less cooked as I did not see any of the browner colored chips that have the most flavor.

Acquire company with high quality brand recognition, sell product to mass merchants, lower quality/cost of product to increase margin and finally sell company just before the customer base starts to realize that the brand is no longer a quality brand.  increased profits make the company more valuable on paper so they make a nice profit for the investors.

They are NOT the strongest flavour I have ever had...that was from a jalapeno pepper chip which was far too strong for even me!<br />These Backyard Barbeque chips by Kettle, however, have just the right amount of sweetness, (with honey powder, onion and sugar), to take the edge of the stonger flavours<br />(paprika, chili pepper, cayenne pepper, and natural smoke flavour), of which there is less, (they come further down in the list of ingredients than the sweeteners.)<br /><br />The complete list of ingredients of these KETTLE BACKYARD BARBECUE CHIPS, (in the 1-ounce bags, and hopefully, in the 9 ounce bags as well), is as follows:<br /><br />Potatoes<br />Vegetable Oil, (Safflower and Sunflower Oil),<br />Honey Powder, (Dried cane sugar, honey),<br />Rice Powder<br />Sugar<br />Salt<br />Onion Powder<br />Tomato Powder<br />Paprika<br />Torula Yeast<br />Garlic Powder<br />Chili Pepper<br />Citric Acid<br />Cayenne Pepper<br />Paprika Oleoresin, (Colour)<br />Natural Smoke Flavour<br /><br />Naturally cooked, natural ingredients.  The combination is a true taste treat!<br /><br />Of course, as with all ptato chips, moderation is the key.<br />Potatoes contain a LOT of potassium....which gives energy and othr good things....but too much of which can damage kindneys.  The vegetable oil is great -- but too much oil, (as well as too much starch, from the potatoes), can hurt the eyes.  Natural smoke flavour is SO yummy....but it, (as well as sugar), has -- in very large amounts -- been linked to cancer production<br /><br />As far as the starch from the potatoes and oil go, this<br />can be ameliorated, (a bit), by drinking TEA...which is good for the eyes.  But as far as the potassium, (energy - good, too much -- bad for the kidneys), and the sugar and natural smoke flavour, (too much leading to cancer production) -- the only thing is to do what is good in everything.....M O D E R A T I O N...!<br /><br />Twice or three times a month, I allow myself to go on what I call a \"Potato Chip Diet\".  I eat only one large bag, (or the equivalent in small ones), of potato chips all day.  I supplement this with tea, coffee, and lemonade, as well as several servings of Carnation Instant Breakfast Essentials, (I like the Dark Chocolate flavour)  This adds up to fewer calories than I would normally eat, if I had my normal three meals a day plus snacks.  It also teaches me to eat s-l-o-w-l-y, because that one big bag, (or many little bags), never lasts as long as I\'d like.  Anyway, with excercise and sensible eating, the rest of the month, (and keeping my scale nearby, and weighing myself at least twice a day, every day), I\'ve taken off ten pounds in the last three months! : )<br /><br />These BACKYARD BARBEQUE flavour potato chips from KETTLE,<br />are totally scrumptious.

The results are flavors as deep and rich as the colors, and an artisanal display in every bag\"<br /><br />Some have also said that these chips are oily, which is true.

We have taken the extra step of sending our products to independent third party labs to test for the presence of trans fats and results indicate we are \"trans fat free\" meaning none were detected.

A little goes a long way.<br /><br />Using agave nectar: Use 1/3 to 1/2 less agave nectar than you would another sweetener (depending on your taste and the recipe. Recipes with dried fruit need much less), cut the heat in the oven by 25 degrees F; if there is oil in the recipe, cut it by 1/3 (alternately, use a tablespoon or two of sifted coconut flour to absorb more of the liquid -- just don\'t use too much or your recipe will be dry). Additionally, when baking, make sure to mix it with the wet ingredients prior to adding it to the dry. Most bakers might already know this, but remember to read recipes first because sugar is typically added with dry ingredients (unless beaten with butter first).<br /><br />Agave nectar does not crystalize like other sugars do, so you won\'t be able to substitute it for corn syrup in making hard candy.

But actually, that may just be my own over-caution and nothing related to actual chemistry or circumstance.<br /><br />Our primary uses are sweetening yogurt, using it in the little baking I do, and use in salad dressings, fruit desserts, etc. Because we are limiting our sweets consumption,we don\'t use a lot of this, but it\'s nice to have when we need it. I plan to try using it in some homemade jams later this season.

Bluegrass soy sauce is regular style.

Kikoman is less salty initially and has a round, full flavor in the middle.  Doesn\'t have the complex ending flavors.

I haven\'t tried Bluegrass blended in other food as a background flavor, which is how soy sauce is usually used.<br />  Bluegrass is a perfectly good soy sauce.

However, being a bit mild, it goes well with breakfast and/or (gluten-free) baked goodies.

I will buy it again because it\'s a nice, mellow blend, and my favorite daily coffee, Nabob, must now be shipped from Canada. However, on my first order to the Canadian company, it\'s taking a long time to be delivered (still haven\'t gotten it).<br /><br />The reason for only three stars is not about the quality of the coffee but the fact that the description of the product does not mention the fact that this \"Kona coffee\" is actually only 15% Kona. If you look very carefully at the photo of the disc, you can see that information, and there\'s a legal disclaimer saying that the product may not match exactly with the description. So it\'s my fault for not reading more carefully, but I was happy to see what I thought was 100% Kona and wasn\'t careful. I\'ve bought the 15% Kona before in a local store and did know that there was such a product in the Tassimo discs, but I just read the product title and ordered.<br /><br />As I said, the coffee tastes good, the amount of coffee is the usual amount, neither the small cups of some European coffees or the extra large size, and I would recommend the coffee.

It does contain milk, wheat, soybeans and sheanut - so if any of these are an issue for you, then you\'ll want to pass.  It also says on the packaging that the facility they\'re manufactured in also processes eggs and peanuts - the product doesn\'t use either of them, but the disclosure is nice if you\'re particularly sensitive to either.<br /><br />Overall a great snack at a great price - the 10 pack really is 20 of the packets, so that\'s quite a few snacks.

I had heard many people rave about a Japanese snack called Pocky so I figured I would try it out. Just like the description states, its a biscuit stick covered in chocolate. I wouldn\'t say the taste is mind boggling but its very easy to eat and virtually no mess, well, as long as the chocolate doesn\'t melt. Anyways, in case anyone is wondering, I ordered from a seller named Very asia (amazon.com/gp/help/seller/at-a-glance.html?ie=UTF8&isAmazonFulfilled=0&orderID=103-7071944-5595443&marketplaceSeller=1&seller=A3JW437I54SEI1). I believe it took around a 3 weeks to actually get to me (maybe it had to be imported) but when it did, it came well packed and not damaged whatsoever. I\'m definitely considering re-stocking on this in the future if I can\'t find a local store<br /><br />EDIT: Oct 11, 2012<br /><br />*****Inquire the type of pocky from seller before finalizing purchase*****<br /><br />So I decided to restock after I couldn\'t fight the craving anymore. Unfortunately the batch this time was not so good (ordered from different seller because it was cheaper and through Amazon Prime). What I received was not the picture shown on the front page (2 per pack japanese pocky), it was a 1 per pack pocky~ish thing from Thailand. In my opinion, the 1 giant pack compared to 2 smaller packs is definitely a step back. Packaging was fine and I ordered in October when the weather was a bit cooler aka no melted chocolate arriving at the front door. The sticks were coated in some type of thick chocolate that was a bit bitter to the taste, more similar to dark chocolate than milk chocolate. The original Japanese pocky melted almost immediately in your mouth, this one melts slowly as it sits in your mouth.<br /><br />Personally I like the taste of dark chocolate but not when used here as a pocky flavor. I also have terrible self control so I buy things that come in small portions in order to a) not eat everything at once and b) avoid making the fridge a mess by cluttering it with tons of opened items. I can honestly say that I won\'t be overeating when it comes to this batch of pocky because I and my stomach dislike it so much. I won\'t change my original rating because that still holds true for the Japanese pocky but if I were to rate only the Thailand pocky it would be a 3.

I discovered these snacks at an anime convention (though I\'d heard about them before and had seen manga characters eating them). They are very, very slim sticks of biscuity stuff (the flavor to me is a cross between waffle cones and pretzels) that have a charming tiny popping crispness. The chocolate flavor, a nice non-bitter, non-dark, generically pleasing choco-taste, seems to be the most popular (given how fast they sell out at cons), but I prefer the flavor of the strawberry which is like strawberry ice cream. Very nice.<br /><br />This is by no means a health food (it\'s in the same category as a cookie, it\'s got fat and sugar and non-healthful ingredients). But hey, it\'s junk food. We all know it\'s supposed to be OCCASIONAL and not habitual in the diet. Unless you\'re really prone to binge-eating or can\'t stop yourself a whole one of these smaller boxes is not a huge calorie splurge if you stick to a reasonable number. 10 of the chocolate pocky sticks will set you back 125 calories with 5 grams of fat, 3 of them saturated. I wouldn\'t recommend just scarfing down multiple boxes. In fact, just nibble these slowly and have fun with the cool texture effect.<br /><br />If you love the flavor of coconut-chocolate together (like Almond Joy) try the coconut chocolate ones. They\'re really so good, oh man. Hubby says the taste reminds him of the Girl Scout \'caramel delights\" cookies which are, in turn, similar to the old Yes Yes cookies (from the seventies or so).<br /><br />Anyway, if you have read manga or seen anime with young folks eating those stick-looking treats, or seen footage of cute Japanese girls nibbling at skinny little stick treats, this is what they were eating. :) Fun treats.<br /><br />However, with this crazy hot summer, I\'d recommend you look for a local retailer or wait until fall\'s cooler weather. You might get a sticky, clumped mess of Pocky sticks in this deep summer weather. (Look for local stores that specialize in Japanese anime or manga and they\'ll likely carry Japanese snacks like these. In South Florida, Tate\'s Comics has them in a variety of flavors..and FRESH and NOT MELTED).'),(867,27,'B000VKYKTG','Pocky Chocolate sticks','Yummy','Pocky is an incredibly good snack, but more than that, I was impressed with Very Asia\'s packaging.

If they were to not include wrappers those 5 bars would occupy less than 25% of the space inside the box.<br /><br />As far as taste goes they are so-so. On the dry side with a hint of berry flavor.

It\'s not so dense that you want to gag after two bites but also not so light that you can eat the whole box (which really isn\'t that big).<br /><br />I know alot of people complain about the size/packaging and I agree somewhat.

Imagine how excited I was when I saw that Kellog\'s sold this product.  What did I learn?: despite the similar name, this cereal is quite unlike European-style muesli.  While the overall mix of grains and fruits is similar, this cereal is mostly a flake cereal, while a true muesli has no cereal flakes at all.<br /><br />\"Real\" muesli is made of rolled (not flaked) grains; this has pluses and minuses.  On the plus side, milk does not turn European mueslis to mush in a couple of minutes like it does flake cereals.  On the minus side, European mueslis have to be soaked in milk or yogurt for about ten minutes or so (i.e. while you are in the shower, or while the coffee is brewing) or the cereal will be a bit on the chewy side.  For those that are concerned about eating processed foods, rolled grains have been processed less than flaked ones.  (Rolled grains are lightly steamed and then rolled and lightly toasted; flaked grains are fully steam-cooked until they are mush, pressed into flakes, fully baked and then usually sprayed with sugar to extend \"time-to-mushiness.\")  And certainly only the Kellog\'s product contains HFCS.<br /><br />You owe it to yourself to try one of the many other mueslis from Amazon (or better yet, single boxes from a local health-foods store if you have one) and see what you prefer.  I eat the Bob\'s Red Mill product available on Amazon (and one of my local grocery chains) instead of this, and am much more satisfied.  I haven\'t tried Familia (but I\'m not crazy about the idea of the \"fruit flakes\"), and the Dorset products are too fruit and nut heavy for me.  The other products are a hair more expensive than the Kellog\'s, but I\'m willing to plunk down an extra dime or so per breakfast for a far superior product.<br /><br />I\'m surprised Quaker doesn\'t sell a muesli product...

I wasn\'t sure what to expect, but so far, I\'ve been pleased. I tore the plastic open, put the frozen potato on a baking sheet in the oven and put it on 350. 45 minutes later it was done and turned out being delicious. The cheese filling was crispy on-top and the potato itself underneath was nice and soft. No way would they come out as good if put in the microwave, so I\'d say oven cooking these is definitely the way to go. Now, you can obviously make your own stuffed baked potatoes for far cheaper then what Omaha charges for these alone, but as long as you get a good deal on the Omaha website, these simply make a great addition to any Omaha steaks order. As delicious are they are though, I wouldn\'t order a box of JUST these off the site due to the added shipping costs. But like I said, as long as they\'re part of a nicely priced packaged deal, I\'ll definitely take them. Actually, I probably wouldn\'t order any packaged deal in the future from Omaha that didn\'t include these. A big plus, at least for me, is if you check the ingredients list on these, there\'s no partially hydrogenated oils, so there\'s no traces of trans fats, which is very rare with stuffed baked potatoes. Also no high fructose corn syrup, which is another rarity on a food product like this and is always a plus. If you make your own or buy them frozen from your grocery store for example, chances are, the butter used, sour cream, etc. will be full of chemicals, trans fats & high fructose corn syrup. These, not so much. So there is a definite degree of quality with Omahas stuffed baked potatoes. Each potato does have 8 grams of saturated fat, which is 42% the DRV, but that\'s obviously to be expected with anything that contains bacon, cheese and sour cream. I was also expecting there to be no fiber, but it turns out there\'s 3grams of fiber per baked potato half. Another plus.

BOO, amazon!','As another reviewer stated, many of the reviews for this product are actually for a DIFFERENT raw cacao powder- from alive and aware, ecuadorian criollo raw cacao powder. That is what I ordered about 3 months ago and it was AWESOME! I am almost out and when I went to reorder my amazon account directed me to this product, from SAQUIN??, which is NOT what I ordered, and it is more expensive- the same base price but i got it with FREE shipping, not 15 bucks so that is a big price increase.  I know it was still from alive and aware mid-february, but recently something changed.<br />I am really confused/irritated how my review for \"alive and aware raw cacao\" got switched to a different brand from a different seller?!?! i mean, can\'t they just say \"out of stock\" or \"currently unavailable\" like they do with other stuff. why would they switch reviews around?<br />Seems very underhanded to transfer reviews from a different product to a newer one, especially since as the other reviewer stated they are NOT comparable and this stuff from SAQUIN is terrible compared to what we were getting from alive and aware. also the price increase is pretty shocking! i guess it is the market, and raw cacao is in higher demand. Too bad that was such an awesome price for really awesome cacao.<br />I did recently order alive and aware\'s raw criollo cacao nibs and i highly recommend those. they are as the description states, from alive and aware, not another brand.<br />Frankly I am beginning to wonder about some of the \"brands\" and \"vendors\" that ship from Amazon. I know they have warehouses in different parts of the country, but it is a little suspicious and I just wish there was more transparency about what comes from Amazon and what comes from a different company. seems like halal everyday, alive and aware, etc, are almost interchangable since amazon took the liberty to take reviews from alive and aware and post them to halaleveryday/saquin. are these really different companies, under the auspices of amazon, or is it amazon by a different name only? like the other reviewer said, he ordered something that said \"alive and aware\" in the description and when it came it was from saquin/halal everyday.  who knows. i just want some more transparency so i can have more trust when ordering from amazon.<br /><br />For now, i am going to seek out another source, not through amazon, that stands behind their cacao. it is very important to me, for health benefits and the ecological/social impacts of where it is harvested, to know that i am getting top-notch, certified organic, raw cacao. if amazon is going to be so wishy-washy and sneaky, I\'m going elsewhere. (wagging finger at amazon!)<br /><br />I think for now I will leave the following review for alive and aware in case they do bring it back.<br /><br />Heavens to Besty, this stuff ROCKS!! It is such a good value too, maybe the best out there as I have def shopped around.  I have tried a few different brands of raw organic cacao powder, and this is certainly top-notch.  Kudos to Alive and Aware for offering it at such a reasonable price!!<br />I am not a raw foodie per say, but I try to follow a neo-paleo protocol which includes super foods such as raw cacao.  Properly prepared, with just enough natural sweetener, I think this is a truly guilt-free pleasure.  It is LOADED with antioxidants, as you probably know.  So go ahead, get the big bag.  You can then share it with friends and family and turn them on to this super groovy super food \"of the Gods\" (theobroma) as they say :)<br />My favorite way to consume it is actually as not so hot cocoa- I just whisk it into gently heated fresh (raw) whole milk or cream (so it\'s not too hot and to preserve as much nutrients as possible, I know it\'s not 100% raw  but hey this is how I love it!), add just enough sweetener (I like sorghum molasses, a scant t-spoon), a bit of maca powder, a dash of real salt, and after that\'s thoroughly whisked I top it off with a spoonful of EVO COCONUT OIL- YUMM!!! I have converted everyone, even the kids I babysit (who used to prefer swiss miss). Or I make a concentrated warm cocoa beverage sans maca and coconut oil and then stir it into my raw milk for a half gallon of raw chocolate milk, lightly sweetened.  You better believe it goes fast!!  I love my family to get their good old fashioned grass fed animal fats with bioavailable vitamins A, D and the X- factor (read Weston A Price) and loads of antioxidants from the cacao to boot.  Plus cacao activates the seratonin receptors and sorry I am bit fuzzy but you know it makes you feel good and happy!!<br />Also process it with EVO Coconut Oil and sweetener such as sorghum or honey or maple syrup in your cuisinart for heavenly truffles- refrigerate for proper texture due to coconut oil.  I often toss in soaked,dried nuts and dried unsulfured fruit and shredded coconut for healthy truffle energy bars. just process in batches so it\'s kind of homogenous.

Commercial cacao powder is often triple fermented and then roasted. Commercial companies are more interested in a product which has no nutritional value but great consistency in flavor. Commercial Cacao Powder is mono tonal in flavor. Raw Cacao is everything that Commercial Cacao isn\'t. It is a antioxidant super-food which has no equal. The taste does vary slightly from one part of the year to the next. As to taste, it has a wonderful intoxicating tannin like aroma with mild overtones of Mahogany. In foods it has a complexity which some cooks will absolutely love while the others who read from the book may want to go back to there standard one dimensional cacao. In baking, I believe it goes well with other flavors such as Almond Extract. If you want to do an extraordinary butter cream icing with a tad of Almond extract, your icing will have no equal. In chocolate cake I personally would go heavy and do a buttermilk or sour cream cake. The acid helps to unify and amplify flavors. I like making cake with 60% cake flour which is about has about 5% wheat gluten and 40% rice flour. The reason for this should be obvious. The heavy texture that rice flour imparts makes your cake stand proud and one bite is then never more than enough.<br /><br />Raw Cocoa powder is rich in polyphenols, such as catechins and procyanidins, and has been shown to inhibit low-density lipoprotein (LDL) oxidation and atherogenesis in a variety of models.

These raise the blood sugar which spikes the insulin, a hormone whose message is \"store fat!\" Insulin also causes the kidneys to retain water and therefore I would bloat from a high carb diet.<br /><br />My dilemma is that I love sweets--and now it is not a problem, thanks to products like stevia, a natural plant that has safely been used in parts of the world as a sweetener for hundreds of years. It has no calories and no impact on the blood sugar (although for some people there might be a bit, as the brain is tricked into thinking it is getting sugar). Stevia used to be legal in the USA only as a cosmetic product because of politics: companies that made low calorie sweeteners such as aspartame did not want competition. Yet, aspartame gave me headaches and even sometimes symptoms of multiple sclerosis. So I would use stevia at times, but the aftertaste was bad--and to be honest, I wasn\'t too crazy about the \"during taste\" either.<br /><br />Then I tried NuNaturals. This product is awesome and like no other stevia I have tried. It is not only delicious but also has no aftertaste (unless you put in way too much--a common mistake by people new to this). It comes in tablets and in powdered form (in a bottle or handy packets with individual servings). It also comes in alcohol-free liquid form and even in vanilla flavor. Unlike aspartame (which becomes even more toxic when heated) stevia can be used in baking. NuNaturals has a stevia baking blend just for that. (Since I am a raw fooder, I can\'t tell you how it tastes, but I am sure it is good, judging by their other products.)<br /><br />Thanks to these great products, I can do a low carb raw diet but not be deprived of my sweets!'),(1375,25,'B00068PCTU','NuNaturals White Stevia Powder','Only 6.4% Stevia Extract, but very good flavor','I have mixed feelings about NuNaturals Nustevia White Stevia with Maltodextrin Powder and will probably not purchase it again.  Don\'t get me wrong, it\'s a great tasting stevia extract and very easy to use, but it is just 6.4 percent stevia and 93.6 percent maltodextrin filler.  In other words only 6 pennies of each dollar you spend on this stuff is buying you high quality stevia extract powder.  In my opinion, this is unnecessarily dilute; however, it does make it exceptionally easy to measure.  If the labeling said 6.4% stevia extract, I would have passed on this from the beginning as I can get 70% dry stevia extract of the same quality for much less money per serving of stevia. If this is your first time buying stevia, go for it as it\'s easy to use and tastes great.  If you\'re accustomed to buying and using concentrated stevia extracts, you will be probably be disappointed by the low concentration of this product\'s mixture.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- 5-star taste<br />- Easy to measure<br />- Perfect for first-time stevia users<br />- 3/4 tsp = ~1 tbsp cane sugar<br /><br />Cons<br />- Only 6.4% stevia<br />- Not cost-competitive with 70% or pure dry stevia extracts<br />- 3/4 tsp = ~1 tbsp cane sugar<br /><br />Overall, a good product but not the best value.  I would given it 4 stars if the product labeling didn\'t try to hide the fact that it\'s just not very potent.  For about 1/3 to 1/2 the cost of this product, you can buy concentrated stevia powders and cut them yourself with a low-cost filler like maltodextrin and come out ahead (or just use them full strength, which is often easier once you get used to the sweetening power of pure stevia).<br /><br />In case you\'re wondering where I got the 6.4% (by mass) value from, this is how I calculated it.  On a precise scale, I found the density of this product to be 2.5 grams per teaspoon.  The label says it contains 40mg per 1/4 tsp.  Thus, 1 tsp has 160mg stevia extract in 2500mg mixed powder.  The concentration (mass) comes to 64mg stevia per gram of product or 6.4 percent by weight.

FILL UP THE CAN AND MAKE IT WORTH THE MONEY YOU CHARGE US FOR IT!!!!'),(64805,42,'B0038B38BQ','Chocolate Milk','best way to get my kid his veggies!','maybe this is just coincidence but since starting to regularly drink the wild berry amazing supergrass for kids, our 8 year old has slowly started to develop a taste for vegetables.  a couple of years ago he would only eat fruit but refused any veggies--particularly the green leafy kind that are so good for you.  not wanting him to just depend on multi-vitamins for complete nutrition, i found the amazing supergrass products and decided to give it a try.  it was a great decision.  the wild berry flavor was perfect for him because he liked the fruity taste.  because it is actual wheatgrass and veggies, the superfood powder does not completely dissolve like koolaid would--there\'s still a sediment that remains after you mix it with water.  i thought this might be a problem, but my son just chugged the whole thing and liked it.  needless to say we were delighted and kept giving it to him.  we still tried to make him try some veggies, and after he drank the superfood for awhile he became more amenable to it.  now he eats spinach, broccoli, onions, and carrots!  now i\'d never make the crazy claim that this superfood will make a kid like veggies, but whether it was pure coincidence, acclimation to digesting or tasting the veggie \"sediment\" that is leftover, or psychological acceptance of ingesting vegetables and feeling perfectly fine--it worked!  we will continue to supplement his diet with this wild berry superfood.  as a parent i seriously couldn\'t be happier with it.'),(64806,42,'B0038B38BQ','Chocolate Milk','Kids love it, and think it\'s a treat!','I bought this product in hopes of getting some vegetable nutrition into my kids. Being vegetarians I have always worried about them getting enough vitamins and nutrition to grow healthy. Since they are only 2 and 17 months old, lets just say they are less than pleased with all the veggies! So after finding this i gave it a try. I was shocked at how much they love it! The nice thing is that it has a great chocolate taste, they think they are getting chocolate milk everyday... which is just like a treat to them. I have noticed a vast improvement on they amount of energy they have and there immune system even seems stronger. I would greatly recommend this product for kids or adults. Getting your kids there greens has never been so easy, and prices you can\'t beat!'),(64807,42,'B0038B38BQ','Chocolate Milk','Very picky son drinks this in juice!','My very picky 6 year old won\'t eat any vegetables. He will drink the V8 Fusion juice that has vegetable and fruit juice, so I add a scoop of this daily to his V8 Fusion and he hasn\'t noticed it at all.

They don\'t know what they\'re missing because this stuff is great. I always add a scoop to my veggie shakes (spinach, kale, orange, blueberries, and coconut water). It gives them a nice chocolate flavor without being too sweet.'),(64809,42,'B0038B38BQ','Chocolate Milk','I drink this every day','For close to 2 years now, I have been drinking this every morning.  When the entire family gets a cold, I still get it, but mine starts later, and ends before the rest of my family.  I have found that the powder needs to be mixed with a little bit of yogurt before adding milk.  It just doesn\'t dissolve in milk very well.  But does great in yogurt.  I used to get hungry by 10am and need to constantly snack until lunch.  But between the super food drink and maybe a muffin, I can eat lunch a little later (1:00 instead of 11:30).<br /><br />I know this is the kids version, but I enjoy the taste of this one so much more than either the chocolate or berry in the adult version.<br /><br />My only complaint is that it would be nice if Amazon would carry the larger 100 scoop size of this.'),(64810,43,'B0038B38BQ','Chocolate Milk','Great buy on a tasty health product','I found this in a local health food store and was very pleased with the product.  The ability to save money by setting up repeated delivery was all the incentive I needed.  This is a great way to purchase regularly used health products.'),(64811,43,'B0038B38BQ','Chocolate Milk','this stuff is AMAZING!','I LOVE this stuff! it tastes great and is great for you(It tastes like chocolate milk and my kids will drink it without any fuss). The only downside (if it bothers you which it doesn\'t us) is it is a little harder to mix but that is due to the whole foods this makes it slightly thicker than regular chocolate milk also it settles pretty quickly so if it sets for long it needs to be re-stirred... but again is normal and expected with this type of quality whole foods'),(64812,43,'B0038B38BQ','Chocolate Milk','Great!','My husband hates vegetables which makes me crazy.  This at least makes me feel that he is getting some of the goodness, and it tastes great!

I would highly recommend for kids or picky husbands!'),(64813,43,'B0038B38BQ','Chocolate Milk','Amazing for sure!','I\'m a HUGE proponent of whole food nutrition and this product is fantastic!  Packed with the vitamins, minerals and antioxidants you\'d get from eating a wide variety of fruits and veggies.  Plus its organic and gluten free.  Kids love it... and I use it too!  Highly recommended.'),(64814,43,'B0038B38BQ','Chocolate Milk','My kids like it.','I have two children ages 5 & 6. They used to love fruits and veggies until they got subjected to undesirable eating habits at school and outside our home.  Suddenly the broccoli, bananas, apples, whole milk (only wants chocolate now, thanks public schools!) and whole wheat bread WITH crust on it became a daily struggle at our house. They learned that many kids get away with being a picky eater and now it\'s war at our house.  They now try and demand crust to be cut off sandwiches.  Won\'t do it. They ask for Koolaid and sugary juice boxes.  It\'s a fight for a moment until they realize they\'re not going to win. (Makes me want to homeschool at times or raise my kids in some kind of African village far away from civilization!) Our kids get their fair share of junk food but this culture is innodated by sugar and unhealthy foods at every turn, in everything down to \"healthy\" kids yogurts. I got desperate to find something like a health shake for them to supplement what they\'re not getting..  I had read the reviews on Amazing Grass for Kidz and thought I would try it out. Because our rule is that they need to try something once, they loved it.  Matter of fact, wanted seconds right away.  We make it with banana and milk to make it into a shake. Now, they get one everyday.  And, watch out, it helps with their bowel movements. ;)  I\'m happy to have found something like this and had friends buy it for their kids.  My husband and I bought the adult version of the same thing.  I\'M SOLD!  It\'s still a struggle to get them to eat as healthy as we would like but I\'m happy to know they are getting some of what they\'re missing in this powder.'),(64815,43,'B0038B38BQ','Chocolate Milk','Mommy, I don\'t like chocolate milk!','My kid loves chocolate milk. Or did until I got this, thinking I could sneak some veggies into that little stomach of his.  Mixed it up, didn\'t tell him I had made the swap and handed it to his little smiling face.  He ran away, came back and gave me a full glass back, telling me it was \"icky\".  Later, out of the blue he declared \"mommy, I don\'t like chocolate milk!\" I\'m now trying to figure out how I can sneakily hide this stuff in other foods until I get rid of it.  Maybe chocolate cake?<br /><br />If it tastes as bad as it smells, I can\'t blame the poor guy.<br /><br />I also do agree that the packaging is terribly wasteful.'),(64816,43,'B0038B38BQ','Chocolate Milk','Well, it was worth a shot....','I purchased this as an attempt to get my 3 year old to eat come veggies (was trying to be sneaky and add it to things). Well, it\'s honestly pretty strong and tastes like veggies. He won\'t touch it or anything that has it in it. While I commend their efforts to make a healthy drink, it doesn\'t taste to good and won\'t work in our house.'),(64817,43,'B0038B38BQ','Chocolate Milk','A bit gritty and green','I have to put this in a travel cup for my 5 year old or else he won\'t drink it.  He is too use to the smooth and chocolate colored chocolate milk.  It turns milk into a greenish cast and no matter how you mix it, it is a bit gritty but it does taste good.  I think its worth it for the benefits but when it comes to young ones, the way it looks matters the most.  It might just be my son but he totally thinks greenish milk is not cool (maybe because he associates it with veggies that he doesn\'t like).  I will still purchase it in the future because the positives out way any negatives.'),(64818,43,'B0038B38BQ','Chocolate Milk','Love it!  The perfect superfood for parents and kids.','I\'ve tried other superfoods and couldn\'t get them down, so it was a waste of money and we were still not getting the nutrition we needed, but this is perfect.  It has a great taste and meets our nutrition needs.  The whole family drinks it!  The only downside is the packaging.  I don\'t understand why it needs such a large package to only be halfway full.'),(64819,45,'B0038B38BQ','Chocolate Milk','The Younger the Better (read: easily fooled)','We\'ve all had the crowning jewel of chocolate milk: NesQuik and settled for Hershey\'s syrup when not available. This is not that and will never fool you into thinking it is. My 3 year old started on this at 2 and absolutely loves it. My brother\'s 4 year old son - who has grown accustomed to the \"good stuff\" was not fooled by this. A lot of chocolate Carnation Instant Breakfast had to be added to get him to drink it.'),(64820,45,'B0038B38BQ','Chocolate Milk','My son didn\'t like, but I loved it!','This is for sure the best superfood greens on the market. it is good in smoothies or just with milk. It is better blended because it will clump up if stirred. I bought it for my 12 year old because he will not drink my green drink. He still didn\'t care for it much, but he is a picky one. If you like other health chocolate drink, you will love this!'),(64821,45,'B0038B38BQ','Chocolate Milk','Great product','I don\'t mind the taste of this one. It has just enough berry flavor that it just tastes like a vitamin. I tried the Green one and that is soo yucky I can\'t drink it so this flavor works best.

She loves this and drinks about three glasses a day.'),(64823,45,'B0038B38BQ','Chocolate Milk','Love it!!!','I\'ve tried many diff kinds of green powder and had to choke it down by mixing it with a strong flavored juice. It would defeat the purpose! All these nutrients in a processed sugary juice.  No good.  So i decided to get this chocolate flavor at whole foods... to my surprise it blended very well in a smoothie with only a HINT of a green taste.  Oddly enough, when mixed with milk it has zero after taste and actually tastes quite like chocolate milk.  It tastes more like an ovaltine than a nestle quick. But if kids don\'t know the difference they should take to this pretty well!  The key is to dissolve in water first then add the milk.  I\'ve been adding to almond milk and drinking it right up without having to have a \"chaser.\"  Today I mixed with a half a scoop of \"super seed\" fiber (also purchased on amazon) and threw in some hemp seeds with almond milk and it tastes great! Like chocolate covered nuts.  Really enjoyed it and will be using this method to get in my daily vegetable intake.  I also would like to mention the amazon price is most definitely the best deal-- especially when you do subscribe and save. 5 stars!'),(64824,45,'B0038B38BQ','Chocolate Milk','Yummy drink','I mix this with raw meal, a little more cocoa powder, rice milk and almond milk.

What more can you ask for?'),(64828,46,'B0038B38BQ','Chocolate Milk','Great nutrititious drink for kids','I bought both the Berry and Chocolate drinks for daughter; however, she preferred the berry since it is sweeter.  I love the facts that it has a rainbow selection of vegetables and fruits some of which my daughter doesn\'t like to eat like spinach and sprouts.  Like another reviewer, I am also not thrilled with the fact that the powder drink contains \"Natural flavor\" which could mean msg.  When I approached a sale person at a major health food grocery store, he didn\'t even know what natural flavor is.  Since we ran out of the powder, I am hesistant to buy this same drink and feed my daughter because of the \"Natural Flavor\" ingredient.  It will be while until I find a good wholesome powder drink for my daughter since originally I planned to replace this drink with her vitamins\' intake.  I give 3 1/2 stars since it has the natural flavor ingredient.'),(64829,46,'B0038B38BQ','Chocolate Milk','chocolate yum!','I use to drink this a few years ago so when i reordered it i thought i was getting the same thing. the label had changed slightly and there was a sticker on it that said, \"It\'s back, you didn\'t like the new chocolate flavor so we changed it back.\" I hadn\'t had it for awhile so i wasn\'t sure if i had the old or the new flavor and this concerned me....no need! This is just a tasty and wonderful as i remember it. I have been feeling sluggish recently and thought i would supplement my diet with this drink. This is a great way to get those fruits and veges you miss in your diet. Will order this again and again! Great flavor and dissolves easily in a little water first before adding milk.'),(64830,46,'B0038B38BQ','Chocolate Milk','Tastes awful','Not only is the canister only 1/3 full but this tastes so horrible. My very un-fussy 4 year old literally spat it out. Thinking maybe she was being fussy I tried it myself and the sickly sweet taste is just vile. I use Vitality Supergreens and Dr Schultz\'s for myself and hoped to find a product that would be just as beneficial but tasty enough for a child - well this is definitely not it. Massive waste of money.'),(64831,46,'B0038B38BQ','Chocolate Milk','It\'s ok','This product does not disolve easy with just stiring, I threw mine into the blender to get it mixed well. I would highly recommend anybody interested in this product should go to their local healthfood store and buy the individual packets first. These packets are single servings of the product and sell for a dollar something, this is a good way to try the product out to see if it suits your family without wasting a ton of money. This is what my husband and I did, we bought two of the chocolate flavor and one of the berry flavor and have tried both out on my preschooler. She didn\'t seem found of either of them, the choclate has a very light chocolate flavor and it had an overpowering after taste of the greens. The berry was just way to sweet I\'ve read people compare it to koolaid and that would be about right if you like your koolaid with 2 extra cups of sugar in it. I have used the second chocolate packet in a breakfast smoothie for her with bananas and peanut butter and that seemed to get ride of the after taste and she seemed to enjoy it.If you don\'t mind being creative and doing a little extra work to mask the flavor of the greens this product could be a healthy addtition to your childs diet.'),(64832,46,'B0038B38BQ','Chocolate Milk','my kids love it!','Both my children love this product when added to their milk.  Tastes almost like real chocolate milk (not as sweet). I recommend mixing a scoop with a small amount of water before adding the milk in to ensure the powder dissolves well.  It\'s great because my 4 yr old son does not like to eat fruits and veggies so this sort of helps supplement his diet given the fact that the powder is a blended mixture of fruits/veggies (he does not know this!)  I have a recurring (every 2 months) order for this product.'),(64833,46,'B0038B38BQ','Chocolate Milk','kids like it','We make lots of smoothies. This powder is very sweet.

My wife and I tried it and didn\'t like it either, so I can\'t blame the kids.  This stuff doesn\'t dissolve completely either, so it looks like your drink is full of sand (I swirled diligently).
